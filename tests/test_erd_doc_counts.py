"""Audit the ERD-derived counts in docs against `docs/erds/erd-data.json`.

Every "N objects / N,NNN fields / NNN relationships" figure in the ERD docs is
hand-copied out of `erd-data.json`, and nothing regenerates them. The headline
triple is swept when the ERD is refreshed — it went 4,190 -> 4,252 fields at 264
and all seven citations were updated — but the **per-domain** counts underneath it
never were, and the sweep does not look at them.

What that cost, measured on the 264 ERD (263 objects):

    Domain Overview table in revenue-cloud-data-model/SKILL.md
      8 of its 9 rows disagreed with the data; the Objects column summed to
      185 against an actual 263, so the table understated the model by 78
      objects while sitting directly under a correct "263 objects" headline.

    domains/*.md headlines
      7 of the 9 disagreed. Only `configurator.md` (4) and `usage.md` (23)
      were right.

15 numbers, not the 13 first counted: the lower tally came from reading Usage
Mgmt's 22 as correct, which it is only if you exclude the `(Core Object)`
variants — the reading this file rejects three paragraphs down. A count is wrong
under the definition you publish, not under the one that flatters it.

The drift is **not** uniformly stale-low, which is why "add the new objects"
would not have found it: `rates.md` and the table both claim 15 Rate Management
objects where the data has 11, an over-claim that predates the 264 refresh — as
in fact every one of these errors does. The per-domain counts in `erd-data.json`
are byte-identical at `release/262`; only `totalFields` moved. So the refresh did
not stale these numbers. They had never been right, and had simply stopped
describing anything measurable. The Approvals row is the clearest
case: it claims 1 object and names `ApprovalSubmission`, while the domain holds 3
and `ApprovalSubmission` is the one tagged with a *different* label
(`Advanced Approvals`).

So this check pins each count to a definition rather than to whatever was true
when someone last counted by hand.

**The definition, stated once here because the docs cannot agree on it
implicitly.** A domain's object count is every object in `erd-data.json` whose
domain resolves to that domain, *including* the `(Core Object)` variants. That is
the only reading under which the per-domain counts sum to the 263 the headline
claims — excluding core objects yields 239, which matches no published figure.
`Advanced Approvals` folds into `Approvals`, mirroring `get_short_domain` in
`scripts/erd/build_erds.py`, which maps that label to the short name "Approvals".
Both Approvals labels now have the same explicit color mapping in the builder
and validator. This suite also checks map agreement, raw-label coverage and
consistent colors for each short domain, and the checked-in viewer payload.
Two operations get from 14 raw labels
to the documented **9**: stripping
the 4 `(Core Object)` suffixes (14 -> 10), then this fold (10 -> 9).

Eight directions are checked, because these fail independently:

1. **`erd-data.json` agrees with itself** — its `stats` block vs the objects,
   fields and relationships actually present. Everything else trusts `stats`
   only after this passes, so a stale generator cannot certify the docs.
2. **Every headline triple matches the totals**, and **every site still states
   one.** The distinctive "N objects, N fields, N relationships" phrasing. The
   second half is the load-bearing half: the first version of this layer asked
   only whether *any* site matched, so a file that reworded its citation — or was
   renamed — left the audit while the run reported clean. Verified: wrong numbers
   in a reworded `scripts/ai/README.md` passed 33/33.
3. **The Statistics block matches the totals.** `docs/erds/README.md` restates all
   three figures plus the domain count as a bullet list, which the triple pattern
   cannot match — so that file was audited at its three prose citations while four
   bullets in it went unchecked.
4. **Every mermaid inventory count matches the diagram it names.** `docs/erds/README.md`
   and `docs/erds/erd-quickstart.md` both inventory the `<domain>.mermaid` files with a
   per-file count — and both carried the *domain* counts corrected above, 16 more
   instances of the same stale set, in files this change already edits. Checked against
   the diagrams, not `erd-data.json`, because they count a different thing: a diagram's
   entity set is determined by what is drawn in it, so it can fall short of its domain
   (objects with no edge worth drawing are left out), match it exactly, or exceed it
   (`usage-management` draws `RatingFrequencyPolicy`, which the data tags Rate
   Management). No fixed ratio holds between the two — an earlier version of this note
   asserted one, and review disproved it from the very counts this file gates.
   Conflating the two is what let them drift, and two of the eight coincidentally
   matched their file, which made the other six look plausible. A third phrasing
   ("all N entities", in prose rather than an inventory) turned up only by
   enumerating every line that names a `.mermaid` file — the manual grep for the
   stale numbers had passed over it twice, because it said "billing domain objects".
5. **Every Domain Overview row matches its domain.** Catches the 8 wrong rows.
6. **Every `domains/*.md` headline matches its domain.** Catches the 7 wrong ones.
7. **The taxonomy is closed and complete** — every domain label in the data folds
   into one of the documented domains, all of them appear in the table, the rows
   sum to the total, every "across N domains" claim matches how many the data
   actually folds to, and the table and the `domains/*.md` set cover the *same*
   domains. This is the direction that catches the *next* refresh rather than this
   one: a new domain label, or a domain silently dropped from the table, is
   invisible to checks 5 and 6 because they only audit rows that exist. The
   two-map agreement is here for the same reason — a domain with a table row but
   no sub-file is invisible to check 6, which iterates the file map, so nothing
   else would name it. The pinned count does move, but it says "something left the
   audit" and prompts you to raise EXPECTED_CHECKS, which would accept the
   unaudited domain. A smoke alarm is not a diagnosis.
8. **Every other figure derived from the data matches it** — the excluded-core
   total and the raw-label count that the definition above quotes to justify
   itself, and the object total where prose states it outside the triple phrasing
   ("covering N objects", "the full N-object schema"). Each is checked *and*
   required to still be cited, so a rewording drops out loudly. These were found
   by listing every numeral in these docs that the data can justify and
   subtracting the gated ones; three earlier rounds each surfaced one more loose
   citation by reading, which is what reading finds. A number quoted to justify a
   rule needs the same gate as the rule.

Two things the pattern deliberately cannot do. It cannot tell the ERD triple from
the org-describe pair, so a doc phrasing that as "254 objects, 3,913 fields, 0
relationships" would fail here — loudly, printing both sides, so the diagnosis is
immediate. And a citation wrapped across more than WINDOW lines escapes the
pattern; that is now a failure of its site's `_states_the_triple` check rather
than a silent skip.

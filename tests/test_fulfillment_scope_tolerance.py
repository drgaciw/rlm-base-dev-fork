Offline invariants for the 264 context-tag tolerance in
tasks/rlm_manage_fulfillment_scope_cnfg.ManageFulfillmentScopeCnfg.

    python tests/test_fulfillment_scope_tolerance.py

No org and no CumulusCI install required: the task module degrades on ImportError
(the same property tests/test_rlm_apex_file.py relies on) and every check here is
pure classification against Tooling API error payloads captured verbatim from a
fresh 264 scratch org.

Why this file exists
--------------------
Release 264 ships the standard SalesTransactionItemGroup context attribute typed
`lookup`, while CustomFulfillmentScopeCnfg validation demands String. Both sides are
platform-shipped, so `prepare_dro` cannot complete on a fresh 264 org and the build
is unblocked by tolerating that one rejection.

A tolerance is a detector, and this branch has repeatedly shipped detectors that
could not fail (see the private plan's #264-23/#264-27/#264-31). The risk here is
specific: "skip the record when the org says no" would also swallow a misspelled tag,
turning a repo defect into a silent no-op. So the skip is gated twice -- on the error
message AND on the attribute's type read back from the org -- and the second gate is
UNREACHABLE from a live test, because the platform emits a different message for a
missing tag ("Enter a valid Item Context Tag.", no "String") and short-circuits the
first gate. Live testing therefore cannot prove the org-side gate works at all; only
these checks can, which is the whole reason they exist.

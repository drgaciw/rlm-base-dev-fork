The gate exists because a skipped check reads like a passing one, so these tests care most

        `MASKED` was a *blacklist* of handler commands — `true`, `:`, `echo`, `exit 0`, `&` — in a file
        that is otherwise whitelists. It was described here as the *last* such blacklist, which was
        wrong when written: `set_flags_ok` and `pip_tail_ok` were both blacklists at the time, and both
        were later found to have holes of exactly this shape and inverted for the same reason.
        `|| sleep 0` is not on it, and `sleep` is in
        `HARMLESS`, so both whitelists waved the segment through as a command the step is meant to
        run while the blacklist saw nothing to refuse: the gate ran, produced a real non-zero verdict,
        and the step exited 0. Verified in bash. Two whitelists and one blacklist disagreeing about
        the same word is where the hole was, so this is stated as the property instead:

        - `&& …` runs only on success, so on failure the line's status is the invocation's — safe.
        - `|| …` and `; …` both make the *tail's* status the line's, so the tail has to end the shell
          non-zero on the failure path. The documented correct edit
          `|| { echo "::error::…"; exit 1; }` passes; `|| sleep 0`, `|| printf ''` and every other
          non-terminating handler do not.
        - a bare `&` backgrounds the invocation, so `$?` is the fork's status — masking, and the
          sneakiest kind, since the real script really does run.

        "Ends the shell non-zero" is two questions, and the first version of this asked neither. It
        scanned for the first segment whose command was `exit` and answered `reraises()` on that
        alone, so four masking tails read as re-raising — all four verified in bash:

        - `|| echo "::error::gate failed"; exit $?` — `$?` is the *echo's* status by then, so the step
          exits 0. This is the worst shape in the set: it differs from the handler this file documents
          as correct only in a brace group, and reads like an improvement on it ("propagate the real
          status" rather than hardcoding 1).
        - `|| { echo …; exit $?; }` — the same thing inside the documented braces.
        - `|| true && exit $?` — the operator beside the terminator is `&&`, so the `exit` is reached
          only when the *handler* succeeded, and `$?` is its zero.
        - `|| { echo …; if false; then exit 1; fi; }` — a real `exit 1`, never executed.

        So the walk tracks both things: whether anything has run since the failure (which replaces
        `$?`), and whether the terminator is reached unconditionally. A control-flow opener anywhere
        in the tail ends the answer at `False` — everything after it is conditional, and an
        unreachable terminator is indistinguishable from an absent one. A handler that genuinely
        needs a conditional can be admitted here deliberately; none does today.

        The same walk fixed a false rejection in the other direction. `; exit $?` was refused, because
        `after_failure` was read off the operator as "a `;` means no failure was caught" — but
        `cmd; exit $?` propagates `cmd`'s status exactly, which bash confirms, and the idiom is a
        normal thing to write. It cost 19 spurious `[FAIL]`s when someone wrote it.

        Matched with `[a-z]` this rejected `set -Eeuo pipefail` — bash confirms `errexit`,
        `nounset` and `pipefail` are all still on — and then reported that the step no longer aborts
        on the first error, which is the worst thing a message can do. Flags are read as a set, so
        additional letters are fine and dropping `e` or `u` is not.

        "Additional letters are fine" was wrong, and refusing `n` for it was the wrong repair —
        a blacklist of one letter, in a file whose every other rule is a whitelist. `set -teuo
        pipefail` then kept both required flags and passed, and `-t` makes bash execute **one**
        command and exit: the `set` itself is that command, so the step exits 0 having never run the
        gate. Verified — `printf 'set -teuo pipefail\\necho X\\n' | bash` prints nothing, status 0.
        `-N` is the same shape from the other side: not a real bash option, so bash refuses the whole
        builtin and applies *nothing*, leaving errexit, nounset and pipefail all off.

        So the letters are whitelisted. `e` and `u` are required; `x`, `E` and `v` are the ones a
        maintainer plausibly adds (tracing, errtrace, verbose) and none of them changes whether a
        command runs or whether its failure is fatal. Any other letter — real, invalid, or
        inert-looking — has to be added here deliberately, which is a two-word edit and a decision
        someone made on purpose.

        The whitelist then had to cover `-o`'s *values* too, and did not: `opts` was collected and
        only asked whether `pipefail` was in it, so `set -euo pipefail -o noexec` passed with every
        required letter present — and `noexec` **is** `-n`, the exact option the paragraph above says
        the letter whitelist exists to refuse. `-o onecmd` is `-t`, the other one. Both verified: a
        step opening with either prints nothing and exits 0, so the gate never runs. The long spelling
        walked through the hole the short spelling was closed for, which is the same defect as a
        vocabulary with two answers. `SET_LONG` maps the long names onto their letters so both
        spellings are read by one whitelist; anything not in it is refused.

        That also fixed the mirror-image false rejection. `set -o errexit -o nounset -o pipefail`
        turns on exactly what is required — bash confirms `false | true` still aborts the step — and
        was refused under "the step no longer aborts on the first error", which the first paragraph
        here calls the worst thing a message can do. Folding the names in answers both directions.

# Every rule in this file runs the gate *locally*. That is the one structural blind spot a local guard
# suite has, and it is wide enough to drive through: a predicate keyed on the environment behaves one
# way here and another way in Actions, so the suite can be green about code that never does in CI what
# it does on a laptop. Three separate one-liners exploited it — `if code and os.environ["RUNNER_OS"]:
# code = 0` (zeroes every verdict, since Actions always sets it), and `changed_files()` returning `[]`
# under `GITHUB_ACTIONS` or `CI` (selects nothing, prints "All selected gating checks passed"). All
# three passed 503/503, and no fixture could have caught them, because the fixture is the laptop.
#
# So the property is not "these particular variables are not read" — enumerating the runner's variables
# is the losing game — it is that the gate's behaviour does not depend on the environment at all.

# payload rules ever looked at it. One token added to `CO_REQUIRES` or `PINS`:
#

# reached through the generator instead, which is the general lesson: pinning the consumer of a
# generated value proves nothing about the value.

# Requirement specifiers only: a leading `-` is an option, whitespace inside a token is a second

"""Regression guard for scripts/post_process_extraction.py (todo pack 182).

`get_object_name_from_query` and `parse_select_fields` parse SOQL out of a plan's
`export.json`. A hand-edited export.json can carry a non-string `query` (e.g. a JSON
list), which used to hit `.upper()` on a list and raise AttributeError straight out of
the caller — aborting the whole post-processing run over one malformed declaration. The
validator's equivalent pair was hardened for exactly this in PR #397; these copies were
not. This suite pins the `isinstance(query, str)` guards and proves:

  1. a non-string query is skipped (returns ""/[]) rather than raising,
  2. a whole-plan parse survives a malformed entry — it is RECORDED (not silently
     dropped), and the command then refuses to process or sync the plan rather than
     letting the object's raw CSV overwrite the tracked plan CSV, and
  3. well-formed queries still parse identically (no regression on the #N/A backfill
     logic that consumes the object name + fields).

The same crash class reaches `get_key_columns` via a non-string `externalId` (another
hand-editable export.json field, which hits `.split(";")`); that guard is pinned here too.

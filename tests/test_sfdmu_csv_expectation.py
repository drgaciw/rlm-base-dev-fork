"""Does `validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py` expect a root CSV exactly where one is owed?

The root-CSV check used to fire unconditionally, which made the validator permanently red on
two shapes that correctly have no file at the plan root (`#264-51` / pack 123):

  * `operation: Readonly` — the records are queried from the *target org*, so there is no
    source file to read. The wrong fix is an empty CSV; the right one is not to ask.
  * a per-pass override — the file lives at `objectset_source/object-set-N/<Object>.csv` and
    is validated there. The root path is an *alternative* location, not an extra requirement.

A permanently-red validator is worse than none: it trains readers to ignore the only
automated check this repo has over its data plans, which is how the seven
`mfg-multicurrency` findings survived. So narrowing it is the point — but narrowing a check
is also how a check quietly stops working, and the two gates are only correct while each
stays conditional on its own reason. These cases pin that: an Upsert object with no CSV
*anywhere* must still fail Critical, including when some *other* object has a per-pass file.

Run: `python tests/test_sfdmu_csv_expectation.py` (offline, no org).

    An earlier version matched only `7`/`seven`, which inverted the guard: editing a site to say
    "8 High" removed it from the result set rather than failing, and the only assertion downstream
    was that the set is non-empty — so the one edit the sweep exists to catch was the one edit it
    could not see. Matching *any* count and validating the captured values afterwards is what makes
    a wrong claim a failure instead of a disappearance.

    Anchored on the nouns the repo attaches the count to. That list is wider than it looks
    necessary, and deliberately: a first version matched only `High` and missed
    `sfdmu-data-plans/SKILL.md`, which spells the same baseline "7 zero-byte `Upsert` CSVs" —
    reproducing, in the detector, the exact omission the detector exists to prevent. `findings` is
    *not* in the list, though every real site does end "…High findings": as a standalone noun it
    also matches unrelated review narration ("five of its seven findings"), and a sweep set with a
    false member sends a reader to edit a line that must not change. A noun the repo has not used
    yet is the remaining gap in the other direction; that is why the assertion below prints the set
    rather than trusting it silently.

    Deliberately *not* keyed on `mfg-multicurrency` alone: `plan-dependency-graph.md` names the
    plan and its pack-110 removal without quoting a count, so it needs no edit when the count

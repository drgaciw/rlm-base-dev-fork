"""Offline tests for scripts/ai/check_branch_scope.py.

Runs against throwaway repos built in a temp dir, so no org, no network, and no
dependence on this checkout's branches -- the #264-56 branches have been rebuilt
and merged, so a test reading real history would rot immediately.

The shapes below are the ones that matter, and each maps to a thing that actually
happened rather than to a line of the script:

  clean            a branch cut from base with its own commits
  #264-56          a branch cut from a composed integration branch, whose extra
                   commits have since merged into base (patch-id detectable)
  rebase fix       the same branch after rebasing onto the updated base
  reworded         an inherited commit whose subject was edited -- the case that
                   rules out subject matching
  cherry-picked    the same content committed twice, which is what patch-id is for
  empty            a branch with no commits ahead of base
  stacked          a branch built on an unmerged branch, invisible to patch-id

Also asserts the exit-code contract, because a gate keys on it: 0 clean,
1 findings, 2 tool/usage error. A missing tool must not read as a dirty branch.

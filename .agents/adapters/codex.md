# Codex Adapter

Codex should treat the repo-root `AGENTS.md` file as the canonical safety and
project contract for every task in this repository.

## Instruction mapping

- **Native discovery:** `.agents/skills/<name>` links to the canonical skill
  directory. Use `/skills` or `$skill-name` in Codex CLI. See the
  [discovery guide](../../docs/guides/agent-skill-discovery.md) for tested
  versions and the catalog fallback.
- **Primary instructions:** read and obey `AGENTS.md` first.
- **Task-specific skills:** use [`.cursor/skills/README.md`](../../.cursor/skills/README.md),
  linked from `AGENTS.md`, to select and read the relevant `.cursor/skills/**`
  Markdown files. These files are tool-neutral despite the historical Cursor path.
- **File-specific guidance:** when editing file types covered by
  `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, read the matching rule file as reusable guidance.
- **Cross-repo discovery:** use `.claude/skill-manifest.yml` and
  `scripts/ai/skill_manifest.py` when a task needs PMOS/Foundation skill or
  artifact resolution.
- **Automated PR reviews:** drive review threads to **zero unresolved** using
  `python scripts/ai/pr_review.py` (`status` / `handle` / `verify`), per
  `AGENTS.md` §"Responding to Automated PR Reviews".

## Authoritative files

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. Relevant `.cursor/skills/**` files
3. Relevant `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files
4. `.claude/skill-manifest.yml` for cross-repo skill resolution

This adapter is only a routing note; it does not override `AGENTS.md`.

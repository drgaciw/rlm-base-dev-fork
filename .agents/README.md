# Agent Instruction Stack

This repository uses a layered instruction stack so every AI coding tool can
start from the same project contract and then opt into more specific guidance.
The path names reflect the tools that introduced each file, but most of the
content is intentionally reusable across agents.

## Start with the public library

1. Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for shared project instructions and safety rules.
2. Choose a workflow from the [skill catalog](../.cursor/skills/README.md).
3. Follow the skill's references and validation steps. For native client discovery,
   see the [setup guide](../docs/guides/agent-skill-discovery.md).

The checked-in skills and references work without a private artifacts repository
or a PMOS clone. Reading guides does not require a Salesforce org; running tools
or changing an org requires the setup and access described in the chosen skill.
For contributions, follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Canonical stack

1. **`AGENTS.md` — root safety and project contract**
   - Authoritative for repository-wide safety rules, project context, common
     workflows, pre-merge checks, and a pointer to the skill catalog.
   - Every tool should read this file first and treat it as the top-level source
     of truth unless a direct human instruction overrides it.
   - Tool-specific entry points point back to this file — edit `AGENTS.md` only.
     `CLAUDE.md` is a regular tracked file whose first line is the native
     `@AGENTS.md` import (not a symlink, so it survives a Windows checkout with
     `core.symlinks=false`); `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is a pointer.

2. **`REVIEW.md` — how pull requests get reviewed**
   - Root-level companion to `AGENTS.md`, read by Claude and by Copilot. Defines
     the severity rubric, what a reviewer should look for, the defect classes
     this repository actually produces, and push discipline.
   - Division of labour: `AGENTS.md` governs *what the code must do*; `REVIEW.md`
     governs *how review is conducted*. They overlap on three points by design —
     verifying a finding, sweeping a class, and push discipline — where `AGENTS.md`
     carries the short operational form and `REVIEW.md` carries the reasoning.
   - Applies to human and AI reviewers alike, and to PR authors for the
     one-push-per-review-round rule.

3. **`.cursor/skills/` — tool-neutral skill markdown**
   - Contains detailed task guides such as CCI orchestration, SFDMU data plans,
     Robot testing, UX assembly (under `repo-integration`), schema validation,
     and release enablement.
   - Despite the historical `.cursor` path, these are plain Markdown skills for
     any agent that can read repository files.
   - Use [`.cursor/skills/README.md`](../.cursor/skills/README.md), linked from
     `AGENTS.md`, to choose the relevant entry point.
   - `.agents/skills/<name>` and `.claude/skills/<name>` are relative directory
     links to that same content for native client discovery. See the
     [discovery guide](../docs/guides/agent-skill-discovery.md) for tested
     clients, symlink limitations, and a plain-file fallback.

4. **`.cursor/rules/` — Cursor-specific rule files with reusable guidance**
   - Contains `.mdc` files that Cursor can auto-inject based on edited file
     patterns.
   - Non-Cursor tools can still read these files manually when working on the
     same file types; the guidance is reusable, but the auto-injection mechanism
     is Cursor-specific.

5. **`.claude/skill-manifest.yml` — optional cross-repo skill manifest**
   - Advertises Foundations skills, grounding artifacts, and cross-repo paths so
     agents can resolve shared guidance between this repo and related repos such
     as PMOS.
   - Use it with `scripts/ai/skill_manifest.py` when cross-repo discovery or
     validation is needed. PMOS access is optional; an absent sibling clone
     does not prevent standalone use of Foundations.

6. **`.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Copilot pointer**
   - Directs GitHub Copilot to `AGENTS.md` and summarizes the shared entry
     points.
   - It is an adapter for Copilot, not a replacement for the root contract.

## Authority order

1. Direct human/system instructions for the current task.
2. `AGENTS.md` for repository-wide policy and safety.
3. Relevant skill files under `.cursor/skills/` for task-specific workflows.
4. Relevant `.cursor/rules/` files for file-pattern-specific guidance.
5. Tool adapter files, including `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and the files
   in `.agents/adapters/`, for mapping a tool to the shared instruction stack.

`REVIEW.md` sits outside this ranking rather than inside it: it governs a different
subject (how review is conducted) and so does not compete with `AGENTS.md`. When you are
reviewing a pull request, it is authoritative for that activity.

If guidance appears to conflict, prefer the higher-authority source and document
any important assumption in your response or PR notes.

## Tool adapters

Short adapter notes live in `.agents/adapters/`:

- `codex.md`
- `claude-code.md`
- `cursor.md`
- `copilot.md`
- `agentforce.md`

Each adapter explains how that tool should map its native instruction mechanism
to the repository's existing files and which files are authoritative.

Cursor's file-pattern rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) and the equivalent skill for
each are tabulated in `.cursor/skills/README.md`.

## Other `.agents/` files

The `.agents/` tree also holds supporting context for agents (added alongside
this README):

- `.agents/model-routing.md` — maps work types to model/execution modes and
  defines escalation criteria.
- `.agents/context/project-map.md` — human-readable map of the repository.
- `.agents/context/project-memory.json` — machine-readable project memory,
  validated against `.agents/schemas/project-memory.schema.json`.

None of these override `AGENTS.md`; they are routing and context aids.

## Optional maintainer workflows

### Private work tracker

Maintainers with access to the private artifacts repository use the
[todo-tracker skill](../.cursor/skills/todo-tracker/SKILL.md) for setup and the claim
protocol. Read the index, claim and push before starting tracked work, and retain
the claim through review and merge. Session-local task lists do not replace that
record. These requirements apply when participating in that private workflow;
public contributors can use GitHub issues and pull requests under the contribution
guidelines above.

Keep private tracker payloads and generated working artifacts out of public
commits. `.agents/artifacts/` is gitignored; authorized maintainers synchronize
it as a private nested repository.

### PMOS integration

The [PMOS integration skill](../.cursor/skills/pmos-integration/SKILL.md) explains
optional cross-repository grounding for maintainers with access to that repository.
Its absence is supported; use this repository's checked-in references for standalone
work. Do not copy private PMOS content into public contributions.

# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Revenue Cloud Base
Foundations**. This guide explains how to submit changes using a fork and a
pull request, and what this repository expects before a PR is merged.

> **Repository location.** This project is moving to a Salesforce-owned GitHub
> namespace. The commands below use the repository's current location — if an
> upstream URL no longer resolves, use the **Code → Clone** URL shown on the
> repository page you are reading this from.

## 1. Fork the Repository

To contribute, create your own copy:

1. Open this repository on github.com.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination.
4. GitHub will create your personal fork at
   `https://github.com/<your-username>/rlm-base-dev`.

## 2. Clone Your Fork

Clone your personal fork:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rlm-base-dev.git
cd rlm-base-dev
```

Add the original repository as the upstream remote:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bgaldino/rlm-base-dev.git
```

## 3. Set Up Your Environment

Two supported paths — pick one:

- **Containerized (no local toolchain):** `./docker/rlm setup` — see
  [`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md).
- **Local (Homebrew + pyenv + nvm):** follow the *macOS Environment Setup*
  section of the [README](README.md), then
  [`docs/guides/dev-environment-setup.md`](docs/guides/dev-environment-setup.md)
  for the canonical layered view. On a native Windows checkout (no WSL), see
  [`docs/guides/windows-dev-setup.md`](docs/guides/windows-dev-setup.md)
  instead.

Verify the toolchain before you start (no org required):

```sh
cci task run validate_setup
```

## 4. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your work:

```sh
git checkout -b my-feature-name
```

Use a short, descriptive name. **Never commit or push directly to `main`** —
every change goes through a branch and a pull request.

## 5. Make Your Changes

Before editing, read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — it is the canonical guide for
this repository (and the instruction file every AI coding agent reads). It
carries the safety guards that cause the most review churn when missed:

- Edit `templates/`, never `unpackaged/post_ux/` (auto-generated).
- Keep `force-app/` profiles `classAccesses`-only; layout and app visibility
  live in `templates/profiles/`.
- Do not switch an SFDMU plan from `operation: Upsert` to `Insert` +
  `deleteOldData: true` without explicit maintainer approval — it is
  destructive.
- Never commit real email addresses in `rlm.network-meta.xml`.
- Behavioral Robot Framework changes must be verified against a **live scratch
  org**; `robot --dryrun` is not verification.

Task-specific guidance lives in the skill files indexed in `AGENTS.md`
(`.cursor/skills/**` — plain markdown, readable by any tool or human).

## 6. Validate Before You Push

Run the checks that apply to what you changed:

```sh
cci task run validate_setup                                # toolchain + repo sanity (no org)
python scripts/ai/generate_cci_reference.py                # after any cumulusci.yml edit — commit the output
python scripts/ai/check_plan_readme_consistency.py         # plan README ↔ export.json/CSVs (expects 0 errors)
python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py               # SFDMU v5 plan compliance — see the baseline note
python tests/<name>.py                                     # top-level suites — run directly, never via pytest
python -m pytest tests/build_harness tests/txn_data_harness # harness suites — pytest-collected
```

`pyproject.toml` explains the split: top-level `tests/*.py` use a self-contained
`check()` aggregator and would false-pass under pytest, so they are run directly;
the harness suites are the pytest-collected ones. The build-harness suite needs
`pip install -r scripts/build_harness/tui/requirements.txt`, and txn-data-harness
additionally needs `requests` and `PyYAML`.

For LWC work, check the files you touched rather than the whole repo:

```sh
npx eslint <changed-lwc-files>
npx prettier --check <changed-files>
npm test -- --passWithNoTests                              # Jest — the repo has no LWC suites yet,
                                                           # so a bare `npm test` exits 1
```

`prettier --check` formats Apex but never compiles or runs it. **Apex changes
need an org**: deploy, then run the tests, then confirm the permission set is
actually sufficient at runtime.

```sh
sf project deploy start --target-org <alias>
sf apex run test --target-org <alias> --wait 30
```

`--wait` is not optional here. Without it, Apex tests run asynchronously: the
command immediately returns a test run ID and exits 0, which tells you nothing
about whether anything passed. With it, the command waits and reports results.
If the wait expires, it prints the run ID instead — collect the outcome with
`sf apex get test --test-run-id <id> --target-org <alias>`. (`sf project deploy
start` does wait by default, but on timeout it likewise hands back a job ID;
resume with `sf project deploy resume`.)

A green test run is necessary but not sufficient — it runs as an admin. See the
Validation Checks in
[`.cursor/skills/apex-security-hardening/SKILL.md`](.cursor/skills/apex-security-hardening/SKILL.md)
for the read-back and `System.runAs` / persona walk that catch what admin
context hides.

> **Compare against the baseline, don't chase it.** Some repo-wide checks
> already report findings on `main` that predate your change — today that
> includes `npm run lint`, `npm run prettier:verify`, and
> `validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py`. Run the check on `main` first and compare,
> so you fix what your change introduced instead of inheriting the backlog.
> Continuous integration gates on the baseline static checks and the automated
> review, not on these commands.

Documentation is part of the change, not a follow-up: when a task, flag, data
plan, or flow changes, update the docs that name it. The change-surface map in
[`.cursor/skills/doc-consistency/SKILL.md`](.cursor/skills/doc-consistency/SKILL.md)
lists exactly which docs each kind of change touches.

Then commit:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): describe your change clearly"
```

This repository uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
— `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, with an optional scope
(e.g. `fix(flow):`, `docs(decision-tables):`).

## 7. Push Your Branch

```sh
git push -u origin my-feature-name
```

GitHub will display a **Compare & pull request** button.

## 8. Open a Pull Request

Target **base branch `main`** (Release 264 / Winter '27, API v68.0). Remaining
Release 262 maintenance targets the `262` branch; `release/262` and `release/260`
are frozen references — see *Branch Information* in the [README](README.md).

Prefix the PR title with the Conventional Commit type that matches your
commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`), and write a
description that covers:

```
### Summary
Brief explanation of what this change adds or improves.

### Changes
- List key changes
- Mention new files or docs
- Describe any refactoring

### Motivation
Why this change is needed or helpful.

### Testing
Which validations you ran (and against which org, if any).

### Notes
Anything reviewers should know or follow up on.
```

Avoid generic titles like "Update" or "Fix."

## 9. Address Review Feedback

Automated reviewers (GitHub Copilot, Codex) and maintainers comment inline.
Every review comment is handled to completion, and each review round ends with
**zero unresolved threads**.

[`REVIEW.md`](REVIEW.md) is the canonical protocol — how a finding is verified,
how a round is closed out, and why a round's fixes are batched into a single
push. Read it before responding to your first review.

To update your PR:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address review feedback"
git push
```

Your PR updates automatically.

## 10. Keep Your Fork Updated

Start each new branch from the latest upstream `main`. This keeps your work
current without pushing to any `main` branch — which
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) prohibits:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b my-next-feature upstream/main
```

Nothing in this workflow reads your fork's own `main`, so it can stay as it is.
If you would rather keep it current, use your fork's **Sync fork** button on
GitHub instead of pushing from the command line.

## 11. Merge

A maintainer merges your PR after approval and green checks.

## Summary

- Fork the repo, clone your fork, add the upstream remote.
- Set up the toolchain and run `validate_setup`.
- Create a branch — never commit to `main`.
- Make changes following `AGENTS.md`; update the docs your change touches.
- Run the validations for what you changed.
- Push the branch and open a PR against `main`.
- Drive every review round to zero unresolved threads.
- Branch from `upstream/main` for your next change.

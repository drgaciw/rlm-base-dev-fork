"""CCI task that deactivates Agentforce agents via ``sf agent deactivate``.

Supports idempotent re-runs of ``prepare_agents``: the platform rejects
updates to an *active* agent version, so deactivating first lets
``publish_agents`` + ``activate_agents`` re-publish and re-activate.

Agents are discovered from ``aiAuthoringBundles`` — the same source as
``publish_agents`` and ``activate_agents``. This task discovers the *full*
set (``include_excluded=True``): publish/activate skip ``EXCLUDED_BUNDLES``
(bundles that fail to compile on the current API version), but deactivation
must still reach one that a prior/upgraded org left active — deactivating a
missing or already-inactive agent is a no-op, so including it is safe.
This task previously read the ``legacy/bots`` tree, which held the only
Bot + BotVersion agent in the repo; Release 264 retired both
``BotVersion`` and ``GenAiPlannerBundle`` as metadata types (absent from
the v68.0 describe), so that tree and its deploy step are gone and every
agent is now an authoring bundle.

Deactivation is best-effort — if an agent is already inactive, or not yet
deployed, the CLI returns a non-zero exit and we treat that as a no-op
rather than a failure.

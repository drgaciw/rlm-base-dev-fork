"""Shared helpers for the Agentforce publish/activate CCI tasks.

``publish_agents`` and ``activate_agents`` both discover agents from disk and
invoke an ``sf agent ...`` subcommand with ``--json``, then interpret the
standard Salesforce CLI JSON envelope (``{status, result, warnings}``) the
same way. This module holds that common logic so the two task classes stay in
sync — in particular they share a single success contract (top-level
``status == 0``), removing the divergence where one task checked ``status``
and the other checked ``result.success``.

# Bundles present on disk but deliberately excluded from *compilation* — i.e.
# from ``publish_agents`` and ``activate_agents``.
# See todo pack 187: on v68/264, ``RLM_Revenue_Quote_Management``'s
# ``Configure_Product_Attributes`` action has five currency output params that
# ``sf agent publish`` no longer accepts as scalars, aborting ``prepare_agents``.
# The bundle is a standard agent template that changed 262→264 and has not yet
# been recaptured, so it is omitted rather than hand-patched. The source stays
# on disk (and is still deployed by ``deploy_agents``, which does not compile)
# as the capture target — remove the entry once the 264 template is captured and
# reintroduced.
#
# The exclusion is *operation-specific*, not applied at every call site.
# ``publish_agents``/``activate_agents`` skip the bundle (default), so nothing
# tries to compile or activate it. ``deactivate_agents`` deliberately keeps it
# (``include_excluded=True``): on a 262→264 *upgraded* org the old BotVersion may
# already be published and active, and skipping it there would leave it active
# indefinitely. Deactivation of a missing/inactive agent is a no-op, so including
# it is safe on a fresh org too. (``test_agents`` does not discover from disk; it
# maps a static suite list and never referenced this bundle. Its permission set's
# ``<agentAccesses>`` binding is separately removed in
# unpackaged/post_agents/permissionsets, since that deploys via a directory
# Deploy rather than this filter.)

Validate and fix SFDMU v5 datasets for composite key compliance and configuration correctness.

This script validates SFDMU datasets to ensure they conform to SFDMU v5 requirements,
including proper composite key notation, CSV structure, and documentation alignment.
It can also automatically fix common issues.

Usage:
    python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py [--dataset <path>] [--strict] [--verbose]
    python scripts/validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py --fix-headers --fix-composite-keys [--dry-run]

Options:
    --dataset PATH        Validate a single dataset (default: validate all SFDMU datasets)
    --strict              Treat warnings as errors (fail on Medium-level issues)
    --verbose             Print detailed validation steps
    --fix-headers         Add missing headers to empty CSV files
    --fix-composite-keys  Add missing composite key columns to CSVs
    --fix-all             Enable all fixes (headers + composite keys)
    --dry-run             Show what would be fixed without making changes
    --help                Show this help message

        `value` is the raw, non-null cell (blank/null tokens are filtered by the caller). SFDMU
        casts a NUMERIC-typed field via `Number()` before building the external-Id key
        (`Common._castCsvValueByFieldType`, 5.8.0), so `1`, `1.0`, `01`, ` 1 ` and `1e0` all become
        the one JS number `1` and collide on the key `"1"` — a collision a raw-string count misses.
        A non-numeric (text) field keeps its raw string, whitespace intact (the previous round's
        fix), so ` dup ` and `dup` stay distinct.

        We fold DECIMAL numeric spellings through `float`, the SAME IEEE-754 binary64 representation
        `Number()` uses — not `Decimal`. That gets the binary64-equivalence edges right: `Number()`
        collapses two decimal integers that share a double (`9007199254740992` and `...993`, either
        side of 2**53) to one key, and normalizes signed zero (`String(-0) === "0"`). Equal binary64
        values have equal `repr`, so `repr(num)` is the canonical key; signed zero is folded to
        `0.0` explicitly. `inf`/`nan` and any string `float` cannot parse fall back to the RAW string
        (whitespace preserved) — this is where we stop.

        This deliberately does NOT chase full `Number()` parity — notably prefixed-radix integer
        literals (`0x10`->16, `0o10`->8, `0b10`->2), which `float` rejects and we leave as raw
        strings. That is a bounded scope decision, not an oversight, for two reasons that both cut
        the same way. (1) Offline we have no field-type metadata, so we cannot know which columns
        SFDMU even numeric-casts; `Number()` coercion applies only to numeric-typed fields, and for a
        TEXT field `0x10` and `16` are distinct legitimate strings that folding would FALSELY flag.
        Radix-prefixed forms are far more plausible as distinct text codes than as genuine numeric
        external Ids, so folding them is net-negative for the common (text) case — unlike `1`/`1.0`,
        where folding is unambiguously right. (2) `Number()` parity is a moving target that keeps
        diverging from any offline parser (`Number("010")===10` but `int("010",0)` raises), so each
        step widens false-positive exposure for ever-rarer gains. The correct way to close the
        remaining numeric-field gap is describe-driven type awareness, not wider offline guessing;
        no shipped plan has a numeric single-field externalId, let alone a radix-prefixed one.

        For the decimal forms it does fold: this folds every numeric-looking cell regardless of
        field type. The only thing it over-folds is a *text* external Id that deliberately stores
        numerically-equal-but-distinct decimal strings (e.g. `1` vs `1.0`); for an external Id —
        whose whole job is to identify one record — that is a fragility worth a HIGH, not a
        legitimate distinction, so folding is the safe default.

        A non-blank string with no ` FROM <Object>` clause (a typo like `"SELECT Id"`) passed
        every check above unnoticed: `_extract_object_name` returns `""` for it too, the same
        silent-drop this function exists to report for the other three shapes, just reached via a
        fourth one. `{"apiVersion": "68.0", "objects": [{"query": "SELECT Id", "operation":
        "Upsert", "externalId": "Id"}]}` reported `passed=True` with zero objects validated before
        this branch covered it.

        `obj.get("query") is not None` treated an explicit `"query": null` as absent, after which
        `_extract_object_name` returned "" and the declaration vanished. A plan of only that
        declaration plus a valid `apiVersion` still reported success.

        An outright-missing key is not skippable either, despite `query` being unknowable in both
        cases. `ScriptLoader`'s loader (`ScriptLoader.ts:437-444`, v5.8.0) treats "absent" and
        "present but not a non-empty string" identically: `object.query` becomes `''` and the
        declaration is dropped with an `objectIsExcluded` warning rather than executed. A plan of
        `{"apiVersion": "68.0", "objects": [{"operation": "Upsert"}]}` — no `query` at all —
        reported `passed=True` with zero objects validated before this branch covered the missing
        case, exactly the silent-success gap the non-string branch already existed to close for
        the sibling shape.

        `excluded: true` is exempted, plain-truthy like `_is_live_writable`'s check on the same
        field: the outcome this check exists to catch — SFDMU dropping the declaration with an
        `objectIsExcluded` warning instead of executing it — is exactly what the author already
        asked for. Flagging a bad query there is the same false positive already fixed for
        `operation`/`externalId`/`deleteOldData`: an excluded declaration's content is inert, so a
        defect in it changes nothing SFDMU does.

        Deliberately independent of `_normalized_object_sets`'s runtime pass view. That function
        mirrors SFDMU's own merge — a non-empty top-level `objects` is unshifted as pass 1 ahead of
        `objectSets` (pack 168), so both containers are executed at runtime — the right lens for
        `_is_live_writable`/`_all_pass_configs`, which answer "what does this pass write". This
        check instead asks only whether a declaration is *well-formed*, in whichever container it
        sits. The two callers here (lines ~531-536) mirror the container-type sweep immediately
        above them in this same function (lines 483-493), which also walks both `objects` and
        `objectSets` unconditionally: a malformed element is an authoring mistake regardless of the
        pass it runs as — e.g. a leftover flat `objects` array from before a plan migrated to
        `objectSets` (now a live prepended pass, not a dead one) — so validating only one container
        would make correctness depend on the runtime shape.

        Three call sites need to agree on this and used to disagree: the writable-pass map
        normalized flat plans, `_get_object_configs_for_pass` read `objectSets` raw (so it resolved
        nothing for a flat plan), and `_find_objectset_source_overrides` bounds-checked against the
        raw list (so it discarded every per-pass CSV in a flat plan, reporting only a WARN that is
        suppressed at default verbosity). Any two of those disagreeing is a silent wrong answer
        rather than an error, so the normalization lives in one place.

        It changes what the fix modes *write*, not only what validation reads, and that is easy to
        miss because every justification above is about reading. A flat `objects` plan with an
        `objectset_source/object-set-1/` directory previously had those CSVs discarded before the
        fix loop saw them; now `--fix-headers` writes a header row into them. That is the intended
        behavior — native SFDMU never reads `object-set-1/` itself (pass 1 always reads the plan
        root, per `_objects_owing_root_csv`'s docstring), but this repo's opt-in
        `sync_objectset_source_to_source` task copies it onto the root before SFDMU runs, so a
        correct header there still matters — but no shipped plan has that shape (flat `objects`
        plus `objectset_source/`: zero, and no `object-set-1/` exists anywhere in the tree), so real
        `--fix-all` output is byte-identical either way and nothing would have caught a mistake here.
        Pinned by the fix-mode cases in `tests/test_sfdmu_csv_expectation.py`, which are the repo's

        SFDMU 5.8.0 does not reject this shape — but what it does with it is
        order-dependent and almost never what the author meant, so it is a defect worth
        gating rather than a validator false positive. Source-verified against the
        bundled 5.8.0 checkout:

        - The migration job's task map is keyed by the ScriptObject *instance*
          (`MigrationJob._createTaskMap`: `Map<ScriptObject, MigrationJobTask>`), and
          `_createTasks` walks every object. So each duplicate declaration becomes its
          own task and the object is queried from source and written to target once PER
          declaration — loaded N times, in array order.
        - Its lookup/relationship resolution, though, is keyed by *name*
          (`ScriptObject.setup`: `script.objectsMap.set(this.name, this)`, a last-write-
          wins Map), so every OTHER object that looks this one up as a parent resolves
          against the LAST declaration's config only, regardless of which one actually
          wrote a given record.

        The net is a silently doubled load whose lookup semantics depend on declaration
        order — a copy-paste authoring mistake, not a documented use. No shipped plan has
        this shape (verified repo-wide, todo pack 165), so this is latent; HIGH gates the
        build before it can land. A legitimately per-pass-varying object (Upsert in pass
        1, Update in pass 2) is unaffected — those are DIFFERENT pass indices, each with a
        single declaration.

        Counts only *non-excluded* declarations. SFDMU drops an excluded ScriptObject
        before task creation (`MigrationJob._getAllScriptObjects` filters `!object.excluded`,
        source-verified 5.8.0), so it becomes no task at all — two excluded declarations
        load the object zero times, not twice, and one live beside one excluded is a single
        load. Only two-or-more *live* declarations are the doubled load this flags.
        `excluded` is read with JS truthiness (`[]`/`{}` truthy), matching every other
        `excluded` read in this file.

        Grouping is case-INSENSITIVE, unlike `_all_pass_configs`' keys. `_all_pass_configs`
        keys on the exact FROM-clause casing on purpose (pack 163): SFDMU reads the source
        CSV at `path.join(root, sObjectName)` with no case normalization, so `FROM Widget__c`
        and `FROM widget__c` read genuinely different files on a case-sensitive filesystem.
        But the *target* is the same object either way — Salesforce object API names are
        case-insensitive, and `ScriptObject.name` is the case-preserved FROM name
        (ScriptLoader `_buildObject` never folds it), so two differently-cased declarations
        become two `objectsMap` entries and two tasks that both query and DML the SAME
        target object. That is the same doubled load (an `Insert` plan would insert twice),
        so it must be flagged, while CSV-path validation keeps the exact casing. Folding
        case here can never over-flag: two casings are always one Salesforce object.

        `ScriptObject.operation` instead (see `_is_live_writable`).

        Order matters: `bool` is checked before `int` because Python's `isinstance(True, int)` is
        `True` and `False == 0` — but JS `typeof true === 'boolean'` fails the loader's `typeof
        operation === 'number'` check, so a Boolean is *always* dropped, never read as 0/1.

        An integral `float` (e.g. `2.0`, which `json.load` produces for that literal) is accepted

        single column passed. Verified by the `MERGED CONFIG` cases in

        `<plan>/<Object>.csv` otherwise — except pass 1, which SFDMU always reads from the plan
        root regardless of an `object-set-1/` file or the flag: `Script.ts`'s
        `rawSourceDirectoryPath` returns `basePath` whenever `objectSetIndex` is falsy (index 0) OR
        `useSeparatedCSVFiles` is falsy — pass 1 has no `useSeparatedCSVFiles` escape hatch, and
        passes 2..n have no escape hatch *without* the flag. `objectset_source/object-set-1/`
        becomes readable only through this repo's opt-in `sync_objectset_source_to_source` step
        (`tasks/rlm_sfdmu.py:187-205,390-391`), which copies it onto the root before SFDMU runs —
        it is never a substitute for the root file itself. So the root file is owed as soon as
        *any* writable pass lacks a flag-gated override, pass 1 always included; keyed on the pass
        and not on the object name for the same reason.

        Keying on the name is a live false negative, not a hypothetical one: `BillingPolicy` in
        `qb/en-US/qb-billing` is `Upsert` in pass 1 and `Update` in pass 3, and only pass 3 has an
        override. Exempting the object because *an* override exists means pass 1 — which reads the
        root file — stops being checked, and deleting that file leaves the plan reporting PASS.
        Sixteen objects across seven scanned plans have this shape — eleven of them in the five that
        `cumulusci.yml` wires, the other five in `mfg-billing`/`mfg-tax`, which it does not. Of the
        **seventeen objects that carry a per-pass override**, exactly one
        (`procedure-plans/ProcedurePlanOption`) is declared in a single pass, which is the only shape
        a name-keyed gate gets right. The domain restriction matters: repo-wide, 399 objects are
        single-pass, so "exactly one" is only true among the objects a name-keyed gate would exempt.

        Shared with `_all_pass_configs` so a per-pass config is indistinguishable from a merged one.
        Not cosmetic: the checks read *derived* keys, not the raw declaration — `_validate_external_id`
        reads `fields` (the parsed SELECT), so handing it a raw declaration makes `fields` empty and
        every externalId component read as absent from the query. Measured: forcing `fields` empty
        adds 245 spurious SELECT-coverage findings on top of the documented High baseline, landing
        at 252 High overall. So this normalizer, not the reading-pass scoping below it, is what
        holds that back — the two were conflated in earlier notes quoting 241 and 258, neither of
        which reproduces. Deliberately not spelled as "N High to 252 High": the baseline number
        belongs to `tests/test_sfdmu_csv_expectation.py`'s pinned sites, which is what a reader
        should update when it changes; restating it bare here, next to "High", would read as a
        second live claim that sweep neither discovers (this file is not one of its roots) nor
        keeps in sync — the exact drift its pinning exists to prevent, one document over.

        `externalId` is coerced to `str` here — the single point that does so, now that all three
        config builders route through this function. Four sites downstream call
        `external_id.split(";")`, and a non-string value (a JSON list or object, easy to produce by
        hand-editing an `export.json`) raised `AttributeError` straight out of `main()` and aborted
        **all 39 plans with no report**, rather than reporting the one that is broken. Same threat
        model as the total dedup key in `_dedup_configs` and the other `str()` coercions here.

        Coercion alone was not enough, and the first version of this docstring claimed otherwise: it
        said the `str()` "renders it visibly wrong … so the plan gets reported". It does not. The repr
        contains no `;`, no `$$` and no second `.`, so every downstream gate is skipped and the plan
        reports **nothing at all** — loud failure traded for silent acceptance, which is the worse of
        the two. Hence `externalId_malformed`: the coercion loses the type, so the type is recorded
        here and reported by `_validate_object`.

        # `externalId` gets `obj.get(key)` + a JS-truthiness check rather than `obj.get(key,

        # `this.externalId = this.externalId || DEFAULT_EXTERNAL_ID_FIELD_NAME` — a JS falsy-OR

        # here checked only `is None`, so `"externalId": 0`/`false`/`""` fell through unchanged
        # instead of defaulting to `"Id"`, then got `str()`-coerced and reported malformed below —
        # a false High for a declaration SFDMU accepts and quietly redirects to `Id`. Routed
        # through `_is_js_truthy` rather than a second bespoke falsy check, for the same reason
        # `excluded`/`deleteOldData` are: a list/dict is JS-truthy (`[]`/`{}` are objects, not
        # falsy), so an `externalId: []` still falls through to the malformed report instead of
        # being silently defaulted — only the scalar falsy values redirect.

        # `operation` does NOT get the same treatment, and used to here — a prior version of this

        # `class-transformer`'s `plainToInstance(ScriptObject, rawObject, {exposeDefaultValues:

        independent-traversal class already fixed once in this PR for
        `_writable_passes_by_object`. All three callers already have `all_pass_configs` in scope
        for the same plan, so the old walk was pure duplicate work; it was also a fourth private
        reimplementation of the normalizer's own logic, and reimplementations are exactly how a
        `str(externalId)` coercion landed in `_normalize_object_config` while this sibling, 143
        lines away, went without it — a non-string `externalId` still aborted the whole run for
        any plan with an `objectset_source/` override, which `qb/en-US/qb-billing` has.

        A list, not the first match. `_all_pass_configs` was changed to keep same-pass duplicates;
        this helper was not, so a per-pass override was still validated against whichever
        declaration came first. Readonly or simple-key first, writable composite second: the
        override was accepted without the required column.

        No bounds check on `pass_index`: `dict.get(key, default)` on `all_pass_configs[obj_name]`
        already returns `[]` for any pass this object was never declared in, negative or
        out-of-range alike — the same answer the old explicit `0 <= pass_index < len(...)` guard
        gave, without a comparison that guard's own docstring already said no mutation could kill.

        Callers that need "was this object declared here?" use this; callers that need "which
        declarations write the CSV?" use `_writable_configs_for_pass`. The two questions used to
        be one return, which is why a Readonly-only object with a per-pass CSV would have been
        reported as misfiled if this filtered.

        is not `$$`-notation, whose declaration is not `deleteOldData`, and whose operation resolves
        to `upsert`/`update` — the writes that match a target record by this key. `Id` is NOT exempt:

        malformed-externalId HIGH already fires, and treating e.g. int `1` -> `"1"` as a real
        single-field key would pile a misleading duplicate-key HIGH on the same root cause.
        A blank data row (all fields empty) is not a record, matching `data_row_count`'s own rule.
        The key column must be present in the CSV for there to be values to compare; when it is

        fixer loops, `_validate_external_id`'s nested-path check, and `_validate_csv_file`'s
        composite-column-name check) — stripped, unlike a bare `.split(";")`, because an
        unstripped `"Field1; Field2"` leaves `" Field2"`, which matches neither a parsed SELECT
        field nor the fixer's own (stripped) composite-key column name.

        Empty segments are dropped: a trailing or doubled `;` (`"Field1;Field2;"`,
        `"Field1;;Field2"`) otherwise yields a `""` field that flows into every consumer as a
        component to check, reporting a confusing `externalId component '' not found in query

        a syntactically malformed *string* — so a trailing/doubled `;` is tolerated silently by
        every SELECT-coverage/nested-path consumer of this helper, by design.

        The composite-key-column sites (`_owes_composite_key_column` and its callers) share this
        same drop for a different reason: SFDMU's own `Common.getComplexField` builds the column

        neither this helper's stripping (see above) nor its empty-segment drop byte-matches what
        SFDMU computes for a malformed/whitespace-padded externalId. That gap is accepted, same as
        the whitespace one documented at the `_validate_csv_file` call site: the fixer and validator
        both read this same helper, so they stay convergent with *each other* — a real run's second
        pass sees the same drop and confirms nothing missing — even on input this malformed. Getting
        that to exactly match SFDMU's runtime behavior for a typo'd externalId is not attempted.

"""Fail a branch that carries commits it does not own.

A PR branch cut from a *composed* integration branch -- one built by stacking
several in-flight fixes together to test them as a set -- silently inherits
those other fixes. Its diff then shows files it does not own, and worse, it
shows them in whatever **pre-review** state they were in when the composition
was made. Merging it walks back review fixes that already landed.

#264-56 is the concrete case: `fix/264-agents-authoring-bundle` was rebuilt once
to strip five inherited commits, then re-accumulated the same five from a later
rebase onto the stale composition, and was a day from merging a second time with
them. It carried 8 commits where the PR owned 3.

Two independent signals, because the inherited work may or may not have merged
yet and each signal is blind to one of those cases:

1. **Already upstream** -- `git cherry`, i.e. patch-id equivalence: `-` means
   this commit's content is in the base already, so the branch does not own it.
   This is the #264-56 signal, and it only works once the other PRs have merged.

2. **Shares history with another open PR beyond the base** -- if this head and
   another open PR's head join at a commit the base does not have, that shared
   part is unmerged work belonging to some other PR, and so is invisible to
   signal 1. Found the hard way: while writing this check, the branch for its own
   companion fix was cut from the check's branch, and signal 1 reported clean.
   Needs `--pr`, since it is the PR list that says which branches are in flight.

   Not simple ancestry, which was the first version: that only catches a parent
   which has not *moved* since the branch was cut. Cut at the parent's B, let the
   parent advance to C, and C is no longer an ancestor even though B is still
   inherited and still unmerged -- and `git cherry` cannot see B either, since it
   is not upstream, so both signals reported clean on the shape signal 2 exists for.

   **A shared join is symmetric, so it cannot by itself say who inherited from
   whom**, and four exclusions keep the signal from reporting the wrong branch.
   Every one was a false positive before it was a guard:

   - **Contained in the base.** The release integration PR (`264` -> `main`) has
     the base branch itself as its head, so without this every branch merely *up
     to date* with base was reported -- and being behind base read cleaner than
     being current with it.
   - **A fork's head.** Not in this checkout, and the `<remote>/<branch>` fallback
     would resolve a fork PR on a branch named `264` or `main` to *our* branch of
     that name.
   - **A PR that targets this branch.** That is the declaration of a child stack:
     they are building on us. GitHub records it in `baseRefName`, which is worth
     using precisely because history cannot distinguish it -- a child cut from our
     B while we advanced to C produces the identical graph to a parent we cut from
     at B, and without this the *parent* was told to rebuild over its own work.
   - **A descendant of this head.** The unmoved form of the same case.

   Where none of those apply and the histories have merely diverged, direction is
   genuinely not derivable, and both the output and the remedy say so rather than
   asserting inheritance. Signal 1 still covers every skipped branch.

**What a clean result does and does not prove.** `git cherry`'s `+` means "no
patch-equivalent commit found upstream" -- which is not the same as "this branch
owns it", and the output says so rather than claiming otherwise. The residual gap
is narrow but real: an inherited commit whose upstream counterpart was **amended
or squash-combined** before merging has different content, so signal 1 finds no
match, and its PR is closed, so signal 2 does not list it. Both signals are blind
to that case. It did not arise in #264-56 (all five inherited commits were
patch-identical to their merged versions, which is why `git cherry` marked exactly
those five), and the case that *did* bite -- a stack on an unmerged PR -- is what
signal 2 covers. Treat a clean result as "neither known contamination shape is
present", not as proof of authorship; the diff review still has to happen.

A note on what does *not* work, so neither gets substituted:
`git merge-base --is-ancestor <commit> <base>` is not a detector. Inherited
commits are not ancestors of the base -- but neither is any legitimate new
commit, so it cannot separate them. (The 264 plan named this one before it was
tested against the history.) Matching commit *subjects* against the base works
on #264-56 but breaks on any reworded subject.

Exit status: 0 clean, 1 commits not owned by the branch, 2 usage/tool error. A
missing `git`/`gh` gives 2, never 1, so a gate keyed on the status cannot call a
branch dirty because a tool is absent.

Verified by `tests/test_branch_scope.py` (74 checks) against throwaway repos, not
against this checkout's branches -- the #264-56 branches have since been rebuilt
and merged, so a test reading real history would rot. It reproduces the #264-56
shape (5 inherited + 3 own, reported 5 of 8), the rebase that fixes it, a
reworded inherited commit, a genuinely-merged parent (correctly *not* a finding),
a stale base (which reports clean, so the pre-comparison fetch is load-bearing),
a *failing* fetch (which must exit 2 rather than compare the stale ref it just
failed to refresh -- a guard that fails open is decoration), and the exit-code
contract. Signal 2 is driven end to end through `--pr` with a
stubbed `gh`, which is what pins the exclusions above; an earlier version tested
only `_is_ancestor` in isolation, and deleting the signal outright left the suite
green. Each of these mutations now fails it: emptying the `others` loop,
inverting the ancestor test at the call site or inside it, dropping `stacked`
from the failure condition, disabling the containment or fork guard, and either
removing the fetch or letting it fail silently.

Examples:
    python scripts/ai/check_branch_scope.py --pr 370       # both signals
    python scripts/ai/check_branch_scope.py                # HEAD vs origin/main

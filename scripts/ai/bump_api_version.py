"""Bump the Salesforce API version pinned across the repo (e.g. 67.0 -> 68.0).

Release cutovers have to move every API pin in the tree at once. The 66.0 -> 67.0
bump (commit `4ed9be1b`) was a one-shot manual edit over 127 files, and it missed
whole classes of pin that are *still* stale: 51 meta.xml left at 66.0, nine SFDMU
plans at 66/65, the Robot `SalesforceAPI.py` at v66.0, and several task fallbacks.
This script exists so the next cutover is mechanical, reviewable, and repeatable.

It normalizes every pin it knows about to the target version, rather than only
rewriting the previous release's value -- so historical drift gets corrected in
the same pass instead of accumulating.

Two things it deliberately does NOT touch:

  * Version *floors* (`MIN_API_VERSION`) and non-API versions (the SFDMU plugin
    floor, content-asset `<version>` tags, `32767.0` in gltfFileLoader.js).
  * **Provenance** -- text recording what was observed or verified at a past
    release. Rewriting "verified on 262 / v67.0" to say 264/v68.0 would assert a
    verification that never happened. Same reasoning excludes
    `docs/erds/erd-data.json`, whose metadata block describes which orgs the ERD
    was extracted from; it changes only when the ERD is regenerated.

Match the *whole* two-digit version range in every rule, including the current
target. A range capped at the target (`6[0-7]` when 68.0 is current) stops
matching the moment the repo reaches that target, and then reports "already at
target, nothing to do" — indistinguishable from a clean repo. That has now cost
this script two rules: `python` was blind to 37 in-scope literals and `apex` to
8. Matching the target is a harmless no-op.

Usage:
  python scripts/ai/bump_api_version.py                  # dry run (default)
  python scripts/ai/bump_api_version.py --apply
  python scripts/ai/bump_api_version.py --to 69.0 --apply
  python scripts/ai/bump_api_version.py --verbose         # list every change
  python scripts/ai/bump_api_version.py --check           # exit 1 if anything is off-target

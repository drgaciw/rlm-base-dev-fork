"""Run the mechanical checks a change actually needs, and report the status of every one.

Nothing mechanical ran on a pull request here unless it touched agent tooling: the only
`pull_request` workflow was path-filtered to `AGENTS.md`, `.cursor/**`, `.agents/**` and
`scripts/ai/**`. A PR changing `tasks/`, `tests/`, `datasets/`, `templates/`,
`force-app/`, `unpackaged/`, `robot/` or `cumulusci.yml` got **no** automated check —
not the offline suites, not the dataset validators, not the doc-step or ERD-count gates.
Every one of those was enforced only by an agent reading a checklist, which is the
enforcement that failed in #264-27, #264-55 and #264-56: all three found by hand, late.

**Why a driver instead of `paths:` filters and `if:` conditions in the workflow.** The two
fail in *opposite* directions, and this was documented backwards until a review caught it. A
workflow skipped by path filtering never reports at all: a check required on it stays
**Pending**, and a PR needing it is blocked from merging forever — so a `paths:` filter would
wedge every PR that happens not to touch the paths. A job or step skipped by an `if:`
condition is the reverse: it reports **success**, so it reads exactly like a pass. Selection
therefore happens here, in one job that always runs, with every check reported under an
explicit status. A check that did not run says so on its own line.

Four statuses that are easy to conflate and must not be:

* `SKIPPED` — not selected, because nothing the check covers changed. Benign, but printed.
* `MISSING-DEP` — selected, but its interpreter or a package is absent. **This fails the
  gate.** Treating it as a skip is how a broken install silently turns a gate green; the
  same absence hole that let a documentation check pass by finding nothing to check.
* `ADVISORY-DEP` — the same absence on an advisory check, which does *not* fail the gate.
  A separate label because the two differ only in consequence, and reading one as the
  other is the mistake this list exists to prevent.
* `ADVISORY` — runs, reports, and never fails the gate. No check currently uses it.
  `validate_sfdmu_v5_datasets.py` was the one exception, exiting non-zero on a clean tree:
  two Criticals that were the validator's own false positives (pack 123 fixed them — a
  `Readonly` object owes no source CSV; a per-pass CSV lives under `objectset_source/`), plus
  High findings standing — zero-byte `Upsert` CSVs under `datasets/sfdmu/mfg/en-US/mfg-multicurrency/`
  — real but dormant, because that plan was unwired. *Either* bucket failed the validator, so
  fixing only the Criticals could not turn it gating; pack 110 removed the plan too, and the
  check now gates like every other. The status stays defined for the next check that earns it:
  a check that always fails gets ignored, and an ignored check is worse than an absent one, so
  it gets labelled with the reason instead.

Exit codes follow `check_branch_scope.py`, so a tool error is never read as a verdict:
0 = every selected gating check passed · 1 = at least one failed · 2 = usage or tool error.

        # `datasets/sfdmu/` IS a trigger, and the reason is worth keeping because it was wrong once

        # tree's finding counts (0 Critical, 0 High, since pack 110 removed the unwired
        # mfg-multicurrency plan that carried the last High findings) so the sites quoting those
        # numbers cannot drift. That made the suite dataset-reading: a `datasets/` edit that changes

        # the suite that would fail on it, or the red is only deferred onto the next unrelated PR
        # that touches the validator.
        #
        # The doc trees below are triggers for that same reason, one round later and found by the

        # `baseline_sites()`'s `roots` once rglobbed the whole `tests/` tree, which is why a bare
        # `tests/` prefix lived here — a baseline quotation added or edited in a *sibling* suite had

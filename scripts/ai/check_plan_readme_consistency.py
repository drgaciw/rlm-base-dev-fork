"""Check SFDMU plan READMEs against their export.json + CSVs for drift.

The repo's doc-consistency rule says a plan's README "must match the plan's
export.json". That match was *manual* and drifted badly (record counts, phantom
objects, wrong operations) as the QB datasets grew. This script makes the match
mechanically checkable so drift is caught before it merges, not in a later audit.

For each plan directory (one containing `export.json` + `README.md`) it derives
ground truth from export.json + the CSVs and compares it to two structured
locations in the README:

  1. The **object table** — the canonical *load* table: a markdown table with an
     `Object` column AND an `Operation` column (other columns such as `External ID`,
     `Records`, `v5 Notes` are optional). Tables that lack an `Operation` column —
     e.g. dated "Schema Analysis" / "ExternalId Assessment" tables — are deliberately
     NOT treated as the object table, so a README whose only object-style table has
     no `Operation` column is reported as "Skipped".
     For unambiguously live writable declarations, a valid `Pass` binds the count
     to that pass's source CSV. Other rows retain unordered CSV-count matching
     when files exist; Readonly/Delete/excluded declarations do not require a CSV.
  2. The **file-structure listing** — lines like `Foo.csv   # 315 records`.

Free-form prose and dated changelog/history counts are intentionally NOT parsed,
which keeps false positives low (the two locations above are where drift matters
and where the data is canonical).

A row can carry `<!-- readme-check: ignore -->` to skip every check on that row.
A README that intentionally tabulates only a subset of its export.json objects
can declare the rest with `<!-- readme-check: omit: Name1, Name2 -->` anywhere in
the file, to opt those names out of the missing-object WARN below.

Findings:
  ERROR  record-count mismatch; README references an object/CSV absent from the plan
  WARN   operation / externalId mismatch; a non-excluded plan object missing from the
         README object table (these are more parse-sensitive)

Exit code is non-zero if any ERROR is found, so this can gate a PR. WARN-only
runs exit 0. Use `--strict` to also fail on warnings.

Usage:
  python scripts/ai/check_plan_readme_consistency.py --strict   # all plans (pr_gate.py's own invocation)
  python scripts/ai/check_plan_readme_consistency.py datasets/sfdmu/qb/en-US/qb-pcm
  python scripts/ai/check_plan_readme_consistency.py            # WARN-only — exits 0 on drift a --strict run would fail

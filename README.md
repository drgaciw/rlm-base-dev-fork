# Revenue Cloud Skills Library

**Skills, implementation patterns, and tools from Revenue Cloud Base Foundations.**

Give your coding agent Revenue Cloud knowledge, implementation patterns, and tools
to build, configure, and maintain Salesforce environments. The library brings
together skills grounded in documentation, metadata, and code, supported by
deployment automation and example datasets.

**[Build an environment](#build-and-configure-an-org)**

**This branch:** Release 264 (Winter '27), API v68.0.
See [branch information](#branch-information) before choosing an org or release.

## Start with a skill

1. **Clone or download this repository** and open it in your coding agent's workspace.
2. **Give the agent a task.** Start with the prompt below or pick a capability from the table.
3. **Follow the selected skill.** It links to the relevant references, tools, and verification steps.

```text
Read AGENTS.md and the skill catalog in .cursor/skills/README.md.
Choose the relevant skill, then use the repository's references to explain
how products, pricing, and usage grants relate. Cite the files you use.
```

The skills are Markdown guides that any coding agent with repository-file access
can read. They live under `.cursor/skills/` for historical reasons. Use the prompt
above with Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, or another file-capable agent;
native skill discovery varies by tool
([setup and verified clients](docs/guides/agent-skill-discovery.md)).
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) provides the shared
project instructions and safety rules.

You can explore the checked-in guides and references without connecting a Salesforce
org. Running scripts or changing an org requires the tools and access described by
the selected skill. Keep the full repository available: skills reference files
outside their own folders.

## What this repository provides

Revenue Cloud Base Foundations combines the skills library with automation for
Revenue Cloud, formerly Revenue Lifecycle Management (RLM):

- **Knowledge foundation:** checked-in Salesforce documentation, API references,
  data-model diagrams, metadata, and code to ground the agent's work.
- **Skills and tools:** task guides, scripts, and validation tools for building,
  configuring, troubleshooting, and maintaining environments.
- **Implementation patterns:** QuantumBit example datasets, constraint models,
  context mappings, metadata, and UX templates to inspect and adapt to your needs.

Examples and tools cover **product catalogs, pricing, billing, tax, contract
lifecycle management (CLM), rating**, and more. Browse the
[data plans](docs/guides/data-plans.md) and [skill catalog](.cursor/skills/README.md).

**Skills guide the agent; the repository's tools execute the work.** The main
CumulusCI flow, `prepare_rlm_org`, coordinates deployment, data loading,
configuration, activation, and checks. Feature flags select the capabilities to
include. See the [build-process guide](docs/guides/prepare-rlm-org-build-guide.md)
for sequencing and dependencies, or the [repository map](docs/references/repository-layout.md)
to locate the source files.

## Build and configure an org

Choose the setup path that fits your workstation:

| Path | Guide |
|---|---|
| Containerized toolchain or VS Code / Cursor devcontainer | [Docker environment](docker/README.md) |
| Install tools locally and authenticate | [Local installation](docs/guides/local-installation.md) |
| Maintain or replicate an existing local toolchain | [Developer environment](docs/guides/dev-environment-setup.md) |
| Windows workstation (junctions instead of symlinks, UTF-8, dev dependencies) | [Windows dev setup](docs/guides/windows-dev-setup.md) |

Building requires a Salesforce org with Revenue Cloud licenses and appropriate
metadata-deployment permissions; scratch-org creation also requires a Dev Hub.
The data-loading toolchain requires **SFDMU v5.6.4 or later**.
See the [complete prerequisites](docs/guides/local-installation.md#prerequisites).

Once your tools and org connection are ready, use the
[org quick start](docs/guides/org-operations.md#quick-start). For repeatable builds
with progress reporting and resume support, use the [build harness](docs/guides/build-harness.md).

### macOS Environment Setup

Follow the [local installation guide](docs/guides/local-installation.md#macos-environment-setup-homebrew--pyenv--nvm)
for the step-by-step macOS setup referenced by the contributing guide.

### Claude Code setup

The repository ships a shared Claude Code configuration so every checkout gets
the same guardrails:

- `CLAUDE.md` is a regular file that imports `AGENTS.md`; path-scoped rules live
  in `.claude/rules/` and are generated from `.cursor/rules/`.
- `.claude/settings.json` carries permission rules (secret reads and force-pushes
  denied, org deploys ask first) and two hooks: one blocks edits to generated
  metadata, one checks the skill links at session start.
- Two project subagents in `.claude/agents/`: `rlm-reviewer` (applies
  `REVIEW.md` to a diff) and `sfdmu-plan-auditor` (checks SFDMU data plans).
- On Windows, run `python scripts/ai/link_skills.py --fix` once so the 32 skills
  resolve; see the [skill discovery guide](docs/guides/agent-skill-discovery.md),
  which also covers the optional Salesforce DX MCP server.
- GitNexus users: `.gitnexusrc` stops `gitnexus analyze` from rewriting
  `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`; a tooling check enforces it.

## What changed in September 2026

An agent-driven architecture review and two implementation waves reworked the
agent layer, security, and CI. The review and work-package plan were produced
by [Claude Opus 5.5](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-5-5) acting as
architect in Claude Code, with Claude Sonnet 5 workers implementing the
packages in parallel. Recommendations were grounded in the current Claude Code
and Agent Skills documentation, retrieved through the Context7 MCP server and
the official docs sites, and the implemented changes were then verified with
Perplexity AI research (Sonar via the Perplexity MCP server), with every
source cited in the report. The full review, findings, plan, and Perplexity
verification are in
[architect-review-2026-09.md](docs/references/architect-review-2026-09.md).
Highlights:

- **Agent instructions:** `AGENTS.md` cut from 443 to about 120 lines; detail
  moved to topic rules and skills. `CLAUDE.md` no longer depends on symlinks.
- **Claude Code configuration:** shared settings, hooks, rules, and subagents
  (see [Claude Code setup](#claude-code-setup)); skill sizes capped at 500 lines
  with sub-files; commands and skills de-duplicated.
- **Security:** the SFDMU task no longer logs or passes org access tokens and
  never uses `shell=True`; the scratch-org password task refuses non-scratch
  orgs and takes an injected password; every Apex class declares sharing; the
  record-update service enforces `USER_MODE` and an object allowlist.
- **Python tasks:** a shared REST helper (`tasks/rlm_rest_base.py`) with
  timeouts on every HTTP call, API version read from `sfdx-project.json`,
  silent `except: pass` sites replaced with logging.
- **Windows and encoding:** every text-mode file and subprocess call passes an
  explicit encoding, enforced by `scripts/lint/check_text_encoding.py` and ruff
  `PLW1514`; the previously Windows-only test failures are fixed.
- **CI and supply chain:** Dependabot, SHA-pinned actions, a diff-only lint job
  (ruff, ESLint, Prettier), tool versions pinned once in
  `config/tool-versions.env`, secrets scoped rather than exported image-wide,
  and `requirements-dev.txt` for a reproducible dev environment.
- **Release identity:** active release, prior GA, API version, and PR base branch
  are read from `.agents/context/project-memory.json` and checked for drift.

Apex, permission-set, and Robot changes from this work still need validation
against a scratch org; see the review's wave-2 exit criteria.

## Branch Information

- **`main`**: Salesforce Release 264 (Winter '27, API v68.0) — the current published line, promoted from the `264` branch. 264 is **preview / pre-GA** (no v68.0 GA certification yet); a live 264 org remains ground truth.
- **`264`**: The Release 264 development branch, in sync with `main` following the promotion.
- **`262`**: Salesforce Release 262 (Summer '26, API v67.0) — active maintenance branch for remaining 262 patches through 262 GA; at the final 262 release tip.
- **`release/262`**: Frozen Release 262 GA reference, snapshotted from the pre-cutover `main` at `49a494de`.
- **`release/260`**: Salesforce Release 260 (Spring '26, GA) — prior GA reference.
- Other branches exist for different release scenarios and preview features.

`main` now carries the 264 line; the `262` branch receives any remaining Release 262 patches until 262 GA. This promotion mirrors how 262 was promoted into `main` via PR #208.

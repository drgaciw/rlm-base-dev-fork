# Revenue Cloud Data Model

Revenue Cloud v68.0 (Winter '27 / Release 264) — **263 objects, 4,252 platform fields, 674 relationships** across 9 domains.

The ERD reflects **canonical Revenue Cloud platform schema only**. Custom fields (any `__c` suffix, including project-deployed `RLM_*__c` and managed-package fields) are excluded by validation tooling so the schema stays platform-pure.

**Verified 2026-08-15 against:**
- Two fresh `prepare_rlm_org` 264 scratch orgs — `rlm-base__264merged` and
  `rlm-base__264fresh` (Winter '27, API v68, `ent` shape). They agreed
  field-for-field (254 describable objects, 3,913 platform fields each), so no
  figure here rests on a single org.
- The committed 262 snapshot `scripts/erd/schema_diff/262-schema.json` as baseline —
  the same artifact the previous refresh was built from, and the same org shape, so
  the delta is not confounded by shape differences.
- Core UDD source and the 127-entity orphan classification carried forward from the
  262 pass (`.agents/artifacts/orphan-fields/` — private tracker; may be absent);
  not re-run for 264.

**262 → 264 delta:** **70 fields added, 8 removed**, 0 type changes, 1 polymorphic
reference-target change, 270 picklist values added and 18 removed, across 62 changed
objects. All 8 removals are in the usage domain, and **7 of the 8** are one coherent
change rather than attrition — 264 moved the usage policy bindings off the definition
and runtime objects and onto `ProductUsageResourcePolicy`, the
**product-and-resource-specific** binding site. The 8th,
`TransactionUsageEntitlement.DrawdownOrder`, is a separate change and is the row most
often got wrong — see the table below.

⚠ **PURP is the new binding site, not the only one.** `UsageResourcePolicy` still
carries the same four lookups (`RatingFrequencyPolicyId`,
`UsageAggregationPolicyId`, `UsageCommitmentPolicyId`, `UsageOveragePolicyId`) in a
264 org, bound at **resource** level rather than product-and-resource. Verified on
`rlm-base__264merged` and `rlm-base__264fresh`. When you need the policy that applies
to a specific product's use of a resource, read PURP; `UsageResourcePolicy` is the
resource-wide default.

| Removed in 264 | Where the binding lives now |
|---|---|
| `TransactionUsageEntitlement.ChargeForOverage`, `.RatingFrequencyPolicyId`, `.UsageAggregationPolicyId` | `ProductUsageResourcePolicy` → `UsageOveragePolicy` / `RatingFrequencyPolicy` / `UsageResourceBillingPolicy` |
| `TransactionUsageEntitlement.DrawdownOrder` | **Not on PURP** — PURP has no drawdown field. In 264 `DrawdownOrder` lives on `ProductUsageGrant` (design time) and on the per-transaction policy objects `QuotLineItmUsageRsrcPlcy`, `OrderItemUsageRsrcPlcy` and `BindingObjUsageRsrcPlcy` (runtime). The maintained rating plans already carry `ProductUsageGrant.DrawdownOrder`. |
| `UsageResource.UsageResourceBillingPolicyId` | `ProductUsageResourcePolicy.UsageAggregationPolicyId` |
| `RatingFrequencyPolicy.ProductId`, `.UsageResourceId` | `ProductUsageResourcePolicy.RatingFrequencyPolicyId` (the policy no longer knows its own product/resource) |
| `ProductUsageGrant.OverageChargeable` | `UsageOveragePolicy.OverageChargeable` via `ProductUsageResourcePolicy` |

Only **one** of the eight broke the 264 compile: `TransactionUsageEntitlement.ChargeForOverage`,
which `RLM_UsageUploaderController` read in two places, fixed in #365. #365 names the
other three `TransactionUsageEntitlement` removals alongside it and sources chargeability
from the replacement `UsageOveragePolicy.OverageChargeable`, so those were already known
there — what this diff adds for them is the schema record, not the discovery. Genuinely
first recorded here: `UsageResource.UsageResourceBillingPolicyId`, both
`RatingFrequencyPolicy` lookups, and the removal of `ProductUsageGrant.OverageChargeable`
(which #365 implied by reading from the policy instead, but never stated).
Both `RatingFrequencyPolicy` removals are still selected by the `qb-rating` and
`q3-rating` export queries — see #264-66. Full diff at
`scripts/erd/schema_diff/262-vs-264-diff.md`.

<details>
<summary>260 → 262 delta (previous refresh, kept for history)</summary>

**260 → 262 delta:** **Field-level additive** (45 fields added, 0 removed, 0 type changes, 2 polymorphic-reference targets expanded — e.g. `Invoice.ReferenceEntityId` now also accepts `Opportunity`/`Quote`) with **value-level picklist deltas** of 243 added and 62 removed. The 62 picklist removals are IANA TimeZone renames on datetime-zone fields plus cleanup of unused industry-specific `UsageType` values (`InsuranceRuleAction`, `StageManagement`) on fulfillment objects and a few miscellaneous values. Every removed value was cross-referenced against every CSV under `datasets/sfdmu/{qb,q3,mfg}/**` — **zero maintained-plan rows reference any removed value**. Nine objects with deltas appear in existing SFDMU plans per `scripts/erd/schema_diff/260-vs-262-diff.md` `--impact` output, but **no SFDMU remediation is required**: additive fields cannot break existing CSV imports, and the removed picklist values aren't in use. Full diff at `scripts/erd/schema_diff/260-vs-262-diff.md`.

</details>

**Common misconceptions resolved (DO NOT propagate):**
- The Revenue Cloud "PUG" entity is `ProductUsageGrant`, NOT `ProductUsageGroup` (which doesn't exist in core source)
- `RateCard.Status` does not exist in any Salesforce release. The Status field is on `RateCardEntry` (slot=10, identical across 260, 262 and 264)
- The 262 `RateCardEntry` SOAP DML failure (#262-2) is a runtime platform regression, not a schema change
- The 262 PUR overlap validation enforcement (#262-4) is runtime-gated, not a schema/validator code change

## Quick Rules

1. Use `scripts/ai/query_erd.py` to query object details on demand.
2. Load per-domain files (e.g., `domains/pricing.md`) for detailed field/relationship info.
3. Cross-domain FKs are documented in `cross-domain-relationships.md`.
4. Product2 is the central object — most domains reference it.
5. Standard fields often have API names without `__c` suffix.
6. To validate ERD against an org or refresh from a new release, see `.cursor/skills/schema-validation/SKILL.md`.
7. Custom fields are NOT in the ERD by design. To verify a `__c` field exists, query the org directly with `sf sobject describe`.

## Domain Overview

| Domain | Objects | Key Entities | Purpose |
|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **PCM** | 33 | Product2, ProductCategory, AttributeDefinition, ProductRelatedComponent | Product catalog: products, bundles, attributes, classifications, categories |
| **Pricing** | 27 | PriceBook2, PriceBookEntry, PriceAdjustmentSchedule, ProductSellingModel | Price books, price entries, adjustments, selling models, proration |
| **Rate Management** | 11 | RateCard, RateCardEntry, RateAdjustmentByTier, PriceBookRateCard | Rate cards for usage-based pricing, tiered adjustments |
| **Configurator** | 4 | ProductConfigurationFlow, ProductConfigurationRule | Product configuration rules and flow assignments |
| **Transaction Mgmt** | 58 | Account, Quote, QuoteLineItem, Order, OrderItem, Asset, Contract | Core commercial objects: quote-to-cash lifecycle |
| **DRO** | 32 | FulfillmentPlan, FulfillmentStep, FulfillmentStepDefinition, ProductFulfillmentDecompRule | Dynamic Revenue Orchestration: fulfillment plans, decomposition, orchestration |
| **Usage Mgmt** | 23 | ProductUsageResource (PUR), ProductUsageResourcePolicy (PURP), ProductUsageGrant (PUG), UsageResource, UsageSummary | Usage entitlements, grants, rating, metering |
| **Billing** | 72 | BillingSchedule, Invoice, InvoiceLine, CreditMemo, Payment, TaxPolicy, LegalEntity | Invoicing, payments, tax, GL, collections |
| **Approvals** | 3 | ApprovalSubmission, ApprovalAlertContentDef, EmailTemplate | Approval workflow submissions and alert content |

Counts are every object in `erd-data.json` carrying that domain, **including** the
`(Core Object)` variants — the only reading under which they sum to the 263 above
(excluding those variants gives 239). `Advanced Approvals` folds into Approvals, as
it does in `DOMAIN_MAP` (`scripts/erd/build_erds.py`), which is what makes 9 domains
out of 14 raw labels. `python tests/test_erd_doc_counts.py` enforces both, here and
in every `domains/*.md`; these numbers had drifted to describe nothing measurable
before it existed, so refresh the data and rerun rather than editing a cell.

## Central Object: Product2

`Product2` is the hub of the entire Revenue Cloud data model. Nearly every domain connects back to it:

- **PCM**: ProductAttributeDefinition, ProductCategoryProduct, ProductRelatedComponent, ProductSellingModelOption all reference Product2
- **Pricing**: PriceBookEntry, PriceAdjustmentTier, BundleBasedAdjustment link products to price books and adjustments
- **Rates**: RateCardEntry links Product2 to rate cards via UsageResource
- **Configurator**: ProductConfigurationFlow and ProductConfigurationRule bind to Product2
- **Transactions**: QuoteLineItem, OrderItem, Asset, FulfillmentOrderLineItem, InvoiceLine all carry Product2Id
- **Usage**: ProductUsageResource (PUR) binds Product2 to UsageResource; ProductUsageGrant (PUG) grants usage entitlements per product
- **Billing**: Product2 carries BillingPolicyId, TaxPolicyId — set by billing/tax data plans
- **DRO**: ProductFulfillmentDecompRule and ProductFulfillmentScenario reference Product2

## Querying the Data Model

Use `scripts/ai/query_erd.py` for targeted lookups against the full 263-object schema:

```bash
python scripts/ai/query_erd.py describe Product2         # fields, relationships, domain
python scripts/ai/query_erd.py relationships Product2     # all objects linked to/from Product2
python scripts/ai/query_erd.py domain Billing             # all objects in a domain
python scripts/ai/query_erd.py path Product2 Invoice      # relationship path between two objects
python scripts/ai/query_erd.py search "usage"             # fuzzy object/field search
python scripts/ai/query_erd.py stats                      # domain counts summary
```

For live org introspection, use the Salesforce DX MCP `run_soql_query` tool.

## Source Data

- `docs/erds/erd-data.json` — canonical machine-readable schema (263 objects, 4,252 fields, 674 relationships, custom fields excluded)
- `docs/erds/*.mermaid` — per-domain ERD diagrams
- `docs/erds/revenue-cloud-erd.html` — interactive force-directed graph viewer
- `docs/erds/validation-report.md` — most recent ERD vs org schema gap analysis; records the **expected** feature-gated baseline (9 objects unfindable in a default RLM scratch profile, **0** objects with field gaps, **58** ERD-side fields absent from a stock org — the feature-gated / cross-cloud set carried forward from the 262 pass). Use this file as the diff target for new validation runs — a clean refresh produces zero NEW gaps vs this baseline, not zero gaps absolute. The 262 baseline was 33 objects and 822 fields. The object figure fell to 0 because `--patch` added every field the org had; the field figure fell to 58 through deliberate removal (orphan-cleanup batches plus the 8 fields 264 retired), because `--patch` only ever adds and cannot reduce it. Trust the generated report over any count quoted in prose.
- `scripts/erd/schema_diff/{260,262,264}-schema.json` — fresh-org schema snapshots, **one committed per release**; 264 is the current one. Field metadata in these files is a **dict keyed by field name**, not a list — an accessor written for a list returns `None` for every field and any check built on it silently passes
- ⚠ **The second-org cross-validation is not a committed artifact.** The 264 capture is dual-sourced, but only one snapshot is kept; the second extraction is reproducible rather than stored, so the repo does not carry two 2 MB snapshots per release. To re-confirm, extract the ERD's own object list from a second org of the same release and diff:

  ```bash
  python scripts/erd/schema_diff/extract_schema.py --org <second-alias> \
      --output /tmp/crossval.json
  ```

  Pass **neither** `--objects` nor `--all-objects`: the default reads the object list
  straight from `erd-data.json`, which is what you want. `--all-objects` fails outright
  with `EXCEEDED_ID_LIMIT`, because `EntityDefinition` does not support `queryMore()`.
  Re-run on 2026-08-15 against `rlm-base__264fresh`: 254 objects / 3,913 fields,
  **0 field-set and 0 `referenceTo` differences** vs the committed capture. The 9
  objects reported missing are the documented feature-gated set, not a discrepancy.
  Full workflow in `.cursor/skills/schema-validation/SKILL.md`
- `scripts/erd/schema_diff/262-vs-264-diff.md` — current verified release delta (262 → 264), including the SFDMU plan `--impact` cross-reference
- `scripts/erd/schema_diff/260-vs-262-diff.md` — previous release delta, kept for history

Internal-only (private tracker; may be absent):
- `.agents/artifacts/orphan-fields/orphan-field-ownership.json` — per-entity ownership classification for 127 verified entities (used by the `orphan_batch_helper.py` workflow; not required to audit any claim in this skill).
- `docs/erds/orphan-candidates-after-batch*.md` — per-batch orphan classification reports produced by the cleanup workflow. The final outcome of the cleanup is already baked into `erd-data.json` and `validation-report.md`; the intermediate batch reports are local artifacts only.

# Revenue Cloud Business APIs

API v68.0 (Winter '27 / Release 264). The per-domain reference docs under `postman/docs/` and the viewer at `docs/api/index.html` cover 149 endpoints across 9 domains — 137 re-extracted (grounded) from the 264 (v68.0) developer guide, plus 12 retained/external (six external Salesforce Commerce Payments Billing endpoints under `/commerce/payments/`, outside the 264 RLM guide; five v59-carryover Context Service endpoints, for which the 264 guide has no Business-API section; and one legacy PCM route — `/connect/pcm/products/{productId}/related-records` — with no 264 snapshot article). Paths are relative to `/services/data/v68.0/` but span several resource families — `/connect/`, `/revenue/`, `/commerce/`, `/industries/`, `/global-promotions-management/`, `/asset-management/` — not a single `/connect/` prefix. 264 is pre-GA, so treat a live 264 org as ground truth over the docs. The downloadable Postman collection JSON under `postman/` is still the prior v66.0 baseline and is being regenerated against a live 264 org.

## Quick Rules

1. Paths are relative to `/services/data/v68.0/`. Endpoints span several resource families (`/connect/`, `/revenue/`, `/commerce/`, `/industries/`, `/global-promotions-management/`, `/asset-management/`) — use each endpoint's own path from the reference docs; do not assume a single `/connect/` prefix.
2. Auth: Bearer token from `org_config.access_token`.
3. Context Service: must activate context definition before use.
4. Pricing API computes prices — never write PBE records directly via API.
5. Load per-domain reference docs from `postman/docs/` for full endpoint details.

## API Domain Index

> `Base Path` values below are relative to `/services/data/v68.0` — i.e. `/connect/pcm/` is actually `/services/data/v68.0/connect/pcm/`. Domains span multiple resource families; a domain may expose endpoints under more than one base path. Use each endpoint's own path from its reference doc.

| Domain | Base Path(s) | Key Operations | Reference Doc |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **PCM** | `/connect/pcm/`, `/revenue/product-catalog-management/` | Catalogs, categories, products, attributes, bundles, classifications | [pcm-business-apis-reference.md](../../../postman/docs/pcm-business-apis-reference.md) |
| **Product Discovery** | `/connect/cpq/`, `/revenue/product-discovery/` | Context-aware product search with pricing, entitlements, guided selling | [product-discovery-apis-reference.md](../../../postman/docs/product-discovery-apis-reference.md) |
| **Product Configurator** | `/connect/cpq/`, `/revenue/product-configurator/` | Configuration flows, rule validation, attribute resolution | [product-configurator-apis-reference.md](../../../postman/docs/product-configurator-apis-reference.md) |
| **Pricing** | `/connect/core-pricing/`, `/connect/procedure-plan-definitions/` | Calculate prices, waterfalls, adjustments, promotion evaluation | [pricing-business-apis-v68.md](../../../postman/docs/pricing-business-apis-v68.md) |
| **Rate Management** | `/connect/core-rating/`, `/connect/core-pricing/` | Rate plans, rating waterfalls, usage pricing | [rate-management-apis-reference.md](../../../postman/docs/rate-management-apis-reference.md) |
| **Transaction Mgmt** | `/connect/rev/sales-transaction/` (current place/clone/supplemental), `/revenue/transaction-management/` & `/connect/revenue/transaction-management/` (read, place tracker, promotions, asset upgrade/downgrade/swap), `/connect/revenue-management/` (asset amend/cancel/renew, ramp deals), `/connect/advanced-approvals/`, `/industries/cpq/`, `/global-promotions-management/`, `/commerce/` (deprecated v63 place only) | Quotes, orders, assets, amendments, renewals, cancellations, ramp deals, approvals, promotions | [transaction-management-apis-reference.md](../../../postman/docs/transaction-management-apis-reference.md) |
| **Usage Mgmt** | `/revenue/usage-management/`, `/asset-management/`, `/commerce/` | Usage events, summaries, entitlements, grants | [usage-management-apis-reference.md](../../../postman/docs/usage-management-apis-reference.md) |
| **Billing** | `/commerce/` (billing, invoicing, payments, taxes), `/revenue/billing/`, `/connect/sequences/` | Invoice generation, credit memos, payments, billing schedules | [billing-business-apis-reference.md](../../../postman/docs/billing-business-apis-reference.md) |
| **Context Service** | `/connect/context-definitions/` | Context definitions, mappings, context CRUD | [context-service-apis-reference.md](../../../postman/docs/context-service-apis-reference.md) |

## Common Patterns

### Authentication
All APIs use standard Salesforce OAuth. Use `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header.

### PCM vs Product Discovery
- **PCM APIs** (`/connect/pcm/`): Direct catalog CRUD with standard REST semantics (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH). Admin/integration use cases.
- **Product Discovery APIs** (`/connect/cpq/`, `/revenue/product-discovery/`): Context-aware, buyer-session-scoped catalog operations. Apply context filters, entitlements, and pricing rules. Storefront/CPQ use cases.

### Transaction Lifecycle APIs
The transaction management APIs follow a standard lifecycle:

```
Create Quote → Add Line Items → Configure → Price → Place Order → Create Assets
                                                         ↓
                                              Amend / Renew / Cancel
```

Key endpoints (see the reference doc for exact request shapes):
- `POST /connect/rev/sales-transaction/actions/place` — Place Sales Transaction (the current quote/order entry point; supersedes the v63-deprecated `/commerce/quotes/actions/place` and `/commerce/sales-orders/actions/place`, which are retained only for backward compatibility and cap at 300 line items)
- `POST /connect/rev/sales-transaction/actions/clone` — Clone a sales transaction
- `POST /connect/revenue-management/assets/actions/amend` — Amend asset
- `POST /connect/revenue-management/assets/actions/renew` — Renew asset
- `POST /industries/cpq/quotes/actions/get-instant-price` — Instant pricing

### Pricing APIs
- `POST /connect/core-pricing/pricing` — Calculate prices for a transaction
- `GET /connect/core-pricing/waterfall/{lineItemId}/{executionId}` — Pricing waterfall (audit trail)
- Rate Management uses `/connect/core-rating/rate-plan` for usage-based pricing

### Billing APIs
- Invoice generation, credit/debit memos, payment application
- Billing batch operations for bulk processing

### Context Service
Context definitions store session state and configuration across API calls. Used by Product Discovery, Pricing, and Configuration APIs to maintain buyer context.

## Reference

The cross-domain API reference lives as per-area markdown under
[`postman/docs/`](../../../postman/docs/) — 149 endpoints across 9 domains (PCM,
Product Discovery, Product Configurator, Pricing, Rate Management, Transaction
Management, Usage Management, Billing, Context Service). Of these, 137 are
re-extracted (grounded) from the Release 264 (Winter '27, v68.0) developer guide;
12 are retained/external (six external Commerce Payments Billing endpoints under
`/commerce/payments/`; five v59-carryover Context Service endpoints, for which
the 264 guide has no Business-API section; and one legacy PCM route —
`/connect/pcm/products/{productId}/related-records` — with no 264 snapshot
article). 264 is pre-GA, so treat a live 264 org as ground truth over the guide.

## Interactive Viewer

Open `docs/api/index.html` in a browser for a searchable, collapsible API reference with dark/light theme toggle.

## Postman Collection

The `postman/` directory contains the full Agentforce Revenue Management Postman collection for hands-on API testing.

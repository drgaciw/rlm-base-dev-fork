# Ramped Quotes — Build & Verify Multi-Year Group Ramps

Use this skill to build, verify, or report a **multi-year ramped** Revenue Cloud
quote (one commitment segment per period) over the Connect API, and to get the
per-segment **price uplift** — including **compound** uplift — right. It is
consumable by any AI agent (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, Codex, Windsurf,
Aider).

Two distinct ramp mechanisms exist — do not confuse them:

| Mechanism | Shape | Compounds? |
|---|---|---|
| **Group ramp** (this skill) — `placeSalesTransaction` create → `groupRampAction: EditGroup` → clone × (N−1) | one **`QuoteLineGroup`** per period; segments carry `RampIdentifier` | **Yes** — the group holds `RampUpliftType`, so uplift can compound |
| **Line ramp** — `createRampDeal` on a single line (`/connect/revenue-management/sales-transaction-contexts/{lineId}/actions/ramp-deal-create`) | ungrouped segments (`QuoteLineGroupId=null`) | **No** — no group to hold the uplift mode |
| *(legacy)* `/commerce/sales-transactions/ramp-deals` (v63–66) | quantity/revenue **commitment** ramp on the deprecated `/commerce/` path | out of scope |

**Compound price uplift requires the group ramp.** Build it with the sequence below.

## Quick Rules

1. **A group ramp is a per-period segment structure — and its shape depends on the
   *Multiple Ramp Schedules Per Transaction* setting** (`enableGroupRampMultiSchedulePref`),
   which **this repo enables by default** (`config/project-scratch-def.json`,
   `unpackaged/pre/1_settings/RevenueManagement.settings-meta.xml`). **ON (repo
   default) ⇒ a two-level structure:** a top-level `QuoteLineGroup` with
   `Type='RampScheduleGroup'` and one **segment subgroup per period** nested under it
   (`ParentQuoteLineGroupId` → the schedule group). **OFF ⇒ a single-level list** of
   period groups (`ParentQuoteLineGroupId` null). Either way the call order is: (1)
   `placeSalesTransaction` **create** — Quote + period-1 group + one `QuoteLineItem`
   per product; (2) `groupRampAction: "EditGroup"` — `IsRamped=true`,
   `SegmentType=Yearly`, which (in multi-schedule mode) makes the platform create the
   top-level `RampScheduleGroup` and convert the posted group into segment 1, and
   stamps `RampIdentifier` on its lines; (3) **clone × (N−1)** — one clone per
   *additional* period. A 3-year ramp = create + EditGroup + 2 clones. The exact
   two-level graph and resulting ids must be confirmed by read-back on the target org
   (live-verify rule below).
2. **The group is created plain, then ramped by `EditGroup`.** Do **not** try to
   `POST` an already-ramped group. `EditGroup` sets `IsRamped`/`SegmentType`/dates.
3. **Clone is a separate Connect resource**, not a `groupRampAction`:
   `POST /connect/rev/sales-transaction/actions/clone` with
   `{salesTransactionId, recordIds:[<last ramped group id>] (max 1), options:{lineScope}}`.
   `lineScope` ∈ `AllLines` (default) | `RampedLinesOnly`. **Clone only the last
   segment's group.**
4. **Between mutating calls, poll `Quote.CalculationStatus` to a settled state**
   before the next call. Treat an unrecognized status as *stop and look*, never
   "assume done" (see [Status](build-sequence.md#status)).
5. **Compound uplift is group + engine, not a line write.** Set the per-segment
   percentage in **`QuoteLineItem.UnitPriceUplift`** (writeable). Set the mode in
   **`RampUpliftType`** (`Standard`|`Compound`) on the ramp **group** — with
   multi-schedule ON (repo default), on the **top-level `RampScheduleGroup`** (it
   cascades to segment subgroups and lines); with it OFF, on the single ramp segment
   group. `RampUpliftType` is engine-owned on the *line* and rejected there. The
   compounding itself is driven by the pricing procedure's `PriceRevision` element;
   see [Compound uplift](#compound-uplift).
6. **`RampIdentifier` is the cross-segment linkage — constant per product across
   all segments.** Group the read-back matrix on it, not `SegmentIdentifier` (unique
   per line). `ParentQuoteLineGroupId` is **not** a linkage key: with multi-schedule
   ON a segment subgroup's `ParentQuoteLineGroupId` points to its top-level
   `RampScheduleGroup`; only with it OFF is it null.
7. **Report from the priced quote — never re-price.** PST already computed net
   prices, subtotals, and totals; read them back.
8. **`org_config.username` for `sf` CLI; `access_token` for REST only** (per
   `AGENTS.md`).

## DO NOT

- **DO NOT** write system-generated / read-only fields on the graph: on the line,
  `RampIdentifier`, `SegmentIdentifier`, `EndQuantity`, `NetUnitPrice`,
  `TotalPrice`; on the Quote, `GrandTotal`, `TotalPrice`, `CalculationStatus`,
  `QuoteNumber`. They are computed — the call fails if you set them.
- **DO NOT** write `RampUpliftType` on `QuoteLineItem`/`OrderItem` via Place — it
  is engine-owned there (rejected as not-writeable even when FLS shows editable).
  Set it on the ramp **group** — the **top-level `RampScheduleGroup`** in
  multi-schedule mode (repo default), or the single segment group when the setting is
  off; it cascades to every ramped line in the schedule.
- **DO NOT** use the trial segment type `Trial` — the live enum is **`FreeTrial`**
  (`SegmentType` ∈ `Yearly`, `Custom`, `FreeTrial`, `Prorated`).
- **DO NOT** clone more than one group per call — `recordIds` takes exactly one id
  (the last segment's group).
- **DO NOT** expect a clone to vary quantity or price per period — it copies the
  prior segment as-is. To grow a ramp, set per-segment values (quantity,
  `UnitPriceUplift`) after cloning. Do not fake growth silently; note it.
- **DO NOT** ramp a **bundle** while the CML constraint model is active — a bundle
  re-expands its children on each clone (known issue). Keep ramp demos on
  **standalone** products (`configurationPref.configurationMethod: "Skip"`).
- **DO NOT** treat a null `RampIdentifier` on read-back as a graph mistake — it
  usually means the org's **context definitions are stale**; a Context Definition
  sync fixes it (see `.cursor/skills/context-service/SKILL.md`).
- **DO NOT** claim a build "works" from an offline dry-run — a mutating ramp run
  must be verified against a **live 264 org**, writing only to a confirmed
  **writable** org.

## Entry Conditions

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Build / add a segment to / verify a multi-year **group** ramp quote | This skill |
| Get **compound** per-segment uplift right (the `PriceRevision` engine, `IsCompoundUpliftEnabled`, prerequisites) | [Compound uplift](#compound-uplift) → `.cursor/skills/expression-sets/SKILL.md` |
| Turn on **Advanced Detail Line Pricing** / sync context definitions (a compound prerequisite) | `.cursor/skills/context-service/SKILL.md` |
| Resolve Account / Pricebook / Product2 / PricebookEntry ids | [Discovering ids](#discovering-ids) |
| Build a non-ramp quote → order → asset | `scripts/build_quote_to_asset.py`; `.cursor/skills/txn-data-harness/SKILL.md` |
| The v68 Connect endpoint catalog (place, clone, ramp-deal, amend/renew/cancel) | `docs/salesforce/264/dev-guide/index.md` (tracked 264 dev-guide index — use the `/connect/rev/...` payloads above). **Not** `postman/docs/transaction-management-apis-reference.md`: it is v66 (`/commerce/sales-transactions/...`), an incompatible contract |
| A null `RampIdentifier` / stale context definitions | `.cursor/skills/context-service/SKILL.md` |

## The proven build sequence

Four Connect calls build a group ramp: (1) `placeSalesTransaction` create — Quote + period-1 group + lines; (2) `EditGroup` — marks period 1 ramped; (3) `cloneSalesTransaction` × (N−1) — one clone per additional period; (4) a PATCH graph applying `RampUpliftType`/`UnitPriceUplift` for compound uplift, then a forced reprice. Each mutating call must be followed by polling `Quote.CalculationStatus` to a settled state before the next. Full payloads, field notes, the error-response contract, and the full status enum:
[`build-sequence.md`](build-sequence.md).

## <a name="compound-uplift"></a>Compound price uplift

Compound uplift makes each period's price uplift on the **prior period's factor**
(not the list price). Working in **percent units** (the units `UnitPriceUplift` and
`ApplUnitPriceUpliftPct` carry):
`applied%(n) = [(1 + applied%(n−1)/100) × (1 + unitUplift%(n)/100) − 1] × 100`,
and `NetUnitPrice(n) = base × (1 + applied%(n)/100)`. The `× 100` converts the
compounded multiplier back to a percentage — e.g. uplifts 5% then 3% give
`applied% = 8.15` (not `0.0815`), so `NetUnitPrice = base × 1.0815`. The first
period is the baseline; a 0% period is a *carryover* (prior cumulative multiplier
preserved).

It needs **all** of:

1. **Revenue Settings → Advanced Detail Line Pricing = ON** — this repo now defaults it
   **ON** (`unpackaged/pre/1_settings/RevenueManagement.settings-meta.xml`,
   `enableAdvancedDetailLinePricing=true`; kept in sync across every scratch-def), so
   compound **is** available out of the box (the Compound option is hidden from the Ramp
   Uplift Type picklist only when ADLP is off). The 264 Help (*Compound Uplift for Ramp
   Deals*, `docs/salesforce/264/help/articles/ind.qocal_ramp_deal_compound_uplift.htm.md`)
   describes a hand-authoring path — clone the latest template, add a map line item
   `ItemApplUnitPriceUpliftPct__std` → `itemDetailApplUnitPriceUpliftPct__std`, then sync
   the context — but **none of that is required here**: the tracked
   `RLM_DefaultPricingProcedure` already carries the ramp-path compound `PriceRevision`
   (see prerequisite 4), and the bound ramp attributes plus the `itemDetailApplUnitPriceUpliftPct__std`
   target are **standard/inherited** from base `SalesTransactionContext` (present on the
   live `RLM_SalesTransactionContext`), so **no clone, no map line, and no context sync**
   is needed — verified on a fresh 264 build. Turning ADLP off *after* compound
   quotes/orders/assets exist still corrupts pricing/amendments/renewals. See
   `.cursor/skills/context-service/SKILL.md`.
2. **A group ramp** (this skill) — line ramps can't compound.
3. **`RampUpliftType='Compound'` on the ramp group** — the top-level
   `RampScheduleGroup` in multi-schedule mode (repo default), the single segment
   group when off; it cascades to segment subgroups and lines (Quick Rule 5).
4. **A fully-configured ramp `PriceRevision` element** — the flag alone is *not*
   enough. **Enable Compound Uplift** (`IsCompoundUpliftEnabled=true`) appears only
   after a **lookup table** is selected, and requires bindings for **Ramp Identifier**,
   **Base Price Multiplier** (blank ⇒ 1 for new sale; prior compounded multiplier for
   amend/renew), **Uplift Method** (blank ⇒ silently *standard*, no compounding),
   and **Effective From**/**Effective To** — every segment needs a **unique Effective
   From** or pricing fails for the *entire* ramp group. This is *engine* setup —
   author/inspect it via `.cursor/skills/expression-sets/SKILL.md` →
   [Compound ramp uplift](../expression-sets/SKILL.md#compound-ramp-uplift). The tracked
   `RLM_DefaultPricingProcedure` **now carries this ramp-path compound `PriceRevision`**
   (`IsCompoundUpliftEnabled=true`) directly — the ramp branch
   (`Applyupliftstorampedsubscriptionsitemsduringamendment`, seq 2) was migrated from the
   old `FormulaBasedPricing` `Uplift` BKM by metadata deploy, so it works out of the box
   with no procedure clone. (The 264 Help's "newly-created procedure required" caveat is a
   **UI-authoring** limitation — you can't toggle Enable Compound Uplift on an existing
   procedure in the builder; deploying the full expression set metadata bypasses it, which
   is how the repo ships it.)
5. **`UnitPriceUplift` (per-period %) set per segment** on each `QuoteLineItem`.

**Unsupported for compound** (264 Help, *Considerations for Ramp Deals*,
`docs/salesforce/264/help/articles/ind.qocal_considerations_ramp_deals.htm.md`):
a SKU using **CPI renewal uplift**, **usage-based pricing**, or **derived pricing**
can't compound — don't build a compound ramp on one; its verification would be
invalid. Also: compound **resets on renewal** (Year 1 of the new term is the new
baseline), and records created **before Winter '27** use standard uplift.

Verify numerically by reading back the segments (below).

## Read-back → the ramp schedule

```bash
sf data query --target-org <sf_alias> -q "SELECT Product2.Name, Product2.StockKeepingUnit, \
  SegmentName, IsPrimarySegment, RampIdentifier, StartDate, EndDate, Quantity, \
  UnitPrice, NetUnitPrice, TotalPrice, NetTotalPrice, UnitPriceUplift, \
  ApplUnitPriceUpliftPct, RampUpliftType, QuoteLineGroupId \
  FROM QuoteLineItem WHERE QuoteId='<QUOTE_ID>' ORDER BY StartDate NULLS FIRST"
```

Report: account, products, **TCV** (Σ all line totals across all segments),
per-period subtotal and **% of TCV**, and the ramp-by-product matrix (grouped on
`RampIdentifier`, labelled by `Product2.Name`/`StockKeepingUnit`). Sum the
platform-computed **`NetTotalPrice`** for TCV and subtotals — it is the
**post-discount, prorated** line total that propagates to the posted invoice
(`scripts/txn_data_harness/docs/contracts-sales-txn-quote.md`). `TotalPrice` is the
gross list total and **overstates** TCV whenever an uplift, discount, or proration
changes the net; do **not** sum it, and do **not** derive totals from `Quantity ×
NetUnitPrice` (unreliable for term-priced/prorated lines). Both totals are read-only
(never *set* them) but queryable; all numbers come from the priced quote.

## <a name="discovering-ids"></a>Discovering ids

The ask won't give Salesforce ids — resolve them first. Map spoken product intent
("gen-AI licenses", "premium support") to real SKUs from the catalog; don't invent
SKUs.

```bash
# Account — SELECT CurrencyIsoCode: multicurrency is on (repo default), and it drives
# the Quote/PBE/BillingTreatment currency below.
sf data query --target-org <sf_alias> -q \
  "SELECT Id, Name, CurrencyIsoCode FROM Account WHERE Name = '<name>'"
# PricebookEntry — a ramp needs BOTH Product2Id and this. Match the SKU on
# Product2.StockKeepingUnit (the repo's SKU field, per scripts/build_quote_to_asset.py
# and scripts/txn_data_harness/discovery.py — NOT ProductCode). Filter to the ACCOUNT
# currency and require BOTH the entry and the product active (IsActive = true AND
# Product2.IsActive = true), and read the selling model: a product can expose several
# (e.g. Evergreen / Term Monthly / Term Annual) and the model dictates which line
# fields are legal, so pick a TermDefined one deliberately (not the first row).
sf data query --target-org <sf_alias> -q \
  "SELECT Id, Product2Id, Pricebook2Id, UnitPrice, \
     ProductSellingModel.Name, ProductSellingModel.SellingModelType \
   FROM PricebookEntry \
   WHERE Product2.StockKeepingUnit = '<SKU>' AND Pricebook2.IsStandard = true \
     AND IsActive = true AND Product2.IsActive = true \
     AND CurrencyIsoCode = '<ACCOUNT_CURRENCY>'"
# Group-ramp eligibility: no per-product ramp flag is required — any subscription
# (term-defined) product that meets the requirements is eligible by default (264
# Help). `Product2.CanRamp` is the LINE-ramp flag, not a group-ramp prerequisite.
# BillingTreatment for <TREATMENT_ID> — REQUIRED on a term-defined line with a
# BillingFrequency. Must be Active, match the ACCOUNT currency, and have
# CanChangeBillingFrequency = true (the Place call rejects a treatment without it).
sf data query --target-org <sf_alias> -q \
  "SELECT Id, Name, CanChangeBillingFrequency FROM BillingTreatment \
   WHERE Status = 'Active' AND CurrencyIsoCode = '<ACCOUNT_CURRENCY>' \
   AND CanChangeBillingFrequency = true ORDER BY Name"
```

## Field legality (live 264 / v68.0)

Snapshot — re-verify with a `describe` on the target org. Writeable = createable/updateable on the graph.

## A headless toolkit is in development

A dependency-free `scripts/ramp_deals/` toolkit (schedule math, payload builders,
status polling, read-back invariants) mirroring `scripts/expression_sets/` is being
built on branch **`feat/ramp-deals-core`** (not yet merged to `264`). Until it
lands, use the raw Connect calls above. When it merges, wire its CLIs into this
skill's routing.

## Examples

**Worked example — a 3-year ramp on a standalone SKU** (substitute your own ids):

1. Resolve ids for one eligible subscription (term-defined) product + its standard,
   active `PricebookEntry` in the account currency (no per-product ramp flag needed
   for group ramps).
2. `placeSalesTransaction` create → Quote + "Year 1" group + one line (365-day
   window; resolve a `BillingTreatmentId`). Poll to `CompletedWithTax`.
3. `placeSalesTransaction` `EditGroup` on the Year-1 group (`IsRamped=true`,
   `SegmentType=Yearly`). Poll. In multi-schedule mode read the groups back to get
   the top-level `RampScheduleGroup` id.
4. `cloneSalesTransaction` twice (Year 2, Year 3), each cloning the last ramped
   segment. Poll after each.
5. For compound uplift (step 4 of the sequence): PATCH `RampUpliftType='Compound'`
   on the **top-level `RampScheduleGroup`** and per-segment `UnitPriceUplift`, then
   reprice (`pricingPref:"Force"`) and poll (needs the fully-configured
   `PriceRevision` engine — [Compound uplift](#compound-uplift)).
6. Read back; report TCV, per-year subtotal, % of TCV, ramp-by-product matrix.

Expected compound shape for this 3-year ramp (base 360, uplifts 5/3% — baseline +
2 uplifts = 3 periods): 360 → 378 → 389.34 (applied % 0 → 5 → 8.15). A 4-year ramp
would add a 3rd uplift, e.g. +2% → 397.13 (applied % 10.313).

## Validation Checks

- [ ] Group ramp (per-period segment structure — the two-level `RampScheduleGroup`
      in the repo's multi-schedule default), not a line ramp, if compound uplift is
      in scope.
- [ ] `Yearly` segments are **exactly 365 days** (not calendar-year spans, which hit
      366 on a leap year); `Custom` used for variable/calendar durations.
- [ ] `BillingTreatmentId` resolved on each term-defined line (Active, account
      currency, `CanChangeBillingFrequency=true`).
- [ ] No read-only/system fields written on the graph (see the legality table).
- [ ] `RampUpliftType='Compound'` on the ramp **group** (the top-level
      `RampScheduleGroup` in multi-schedule mode), never on the line; per-segment
      `UnitPriceUplift` set on lines, then repriced with `pricingPref:"Force"`.
- [ ] `CalculationStatus` polled to a settled state between calls; unknown status
      halted, not assumed.
- [ ] Read-back grouped on `RampIdentifier`; every ramped line carries both
      `RampIdentifier` and `SegmentIdentifier` (proves it went through
      `groupRampAction`); TCV reconciles.
- [ ] Compound arithmetic verified against a read-back (applied % compounds on the
      prior factor).
- [ ] Any mutating run executed against a confirmed **writable** live 264 org.

# AI Agent Skills — Discovery Index

These skills are **plain markdown files** usable by any AI agent (Cursor,
Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Windsurf, Aider, or any tool that
can read files). They live under `.cursor/skills/` for historical
reasons but have no Cursor-specific dependencies.

## Start here

Read [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for the shared safety rules, then choose a
capability below. Keep the full repository available: skills link to reference
material, scripts, metadata and datasets outside their own directories.

You can read the checked-in guides without an org connection. Running a tool or
changing an org requires the prerequisites and verification in the selected skill.
Private artifacts and PMOS are optional; neither is needed to use this catalog.

## How Skills Are Structured

Every top-level `SKILL.md` starts with YAML `name` and `description` fields
for discovery: the name matches its directory, and the description explains
what the skill does and when to use it. See the
[authoring requirements](skill-authoring/SKILL.md#discovery-metadata) for the
format and validation constraints. Native discovery paths vary by agent;
the router above remains a plain-file entry point. The repository includes
shared-content links under `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`; see
[native discovery setup and verification](../../docs/guides/agent-skill-discovery.md).

Each top-level skill should include the sections below. **Quick Rules** is
present in every skill today and **DO NOT** in most; **Entry Conditions**,
**Examples**, and **Validation Checks** are the target structure for new skills,
and existing skills are being migrated to add them incrementally:
1. **Quick Rules** — 5-8 numbered rules at the top for fast reference
2. **DO NOT** — explicit safety constraints for that topic
3. **Entry Conditions** — when to read the skill and when to use adjacent guidance
4. **Main content** — tables, code examples, decision guides
5. **Examples** — concrete usage patterns
6. **Validation Checks** — commands and review checks to run before commit/PR
7. **Sub-files** — detailed reference split into separate files (read on demand)

For the full lifecycle checklist, read `skill-authoring/SKILL.md`.

## File-Specific Rules (Cursor Only)

Rules in `.cursor/rules/` auto-inject when Cursor edits matching files.
Non-Cursor agents can read these files directly or use the equivalent skill:

This table is the canonical list — `AGENTS.md` points here rather than repeating it.

| Rule | Triggers On | Equivalent Skill |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| `analysis-artifacts.mdc` | (always applies) | *(stand-alone — AI-generated analysis must go to `.agents/artifacts/`, never the public repo)* |
| `sfdmu-export-json.mdc` | `**/export.json` | `sfdmu-data-plans/SKILL.md` |
| `sfdmu-csv-data.mdc` | `datasets/sfdmu/**/*.csv` | `sfdmu-data-plans/SKILL.md` |
| `cci-task-definitions.mdc` | `cumulusci.yml` | `cci-orchestration/SKILL.md` |

| `apex-scripts.mdc` | `scripts/apex/**/*.apex` | `troubleshooting/SKILL.md` |
| `apex-classes.mdc` | `unpackaged/**/*.cls`, `force-app/**/*.cls` | *(stand-alone — sharing keywords, `Id.valueOf` validation, SOQL safety, test patterns; `repo-integration/SKILL.md` for placement)* |
| `lwc-components.mdc` | `unpackaged/**/lwc/**/*.{html,js}`, `force-app/**/lwc/**/*.{html,js}` | *(stand-alone — template syntax, ARIA/accessibility, performance, error messages; `repo-integration/SKILL.md` for placement)* |
| `ux-templates.mdc` | `templates/**` | `repo-integration/SKILL.md` |
| `robot-tests.mdc` | `robot/**/*.robot` | `robot-testing/SKILL.md` |
| `doc-review.mdc` | `cumulusci.yml`, `tasks/**/*.py`, `datasets/sfdmu/**/export.json`, `datasets/sfdmu/**/*.csv`, `robot/**/*.robot`, `.cursor/skills/**/*.md` | `doc-consistency/SKILL.md` |
| `context-plans.mdc` | `datasets/context_plans/**/*.json` | `context-service/SKILL.md` |
| `protected-metadata.mdc` | `force-app/**/profiles/**`, `force-app/**/*.object-meta.xml`, `templates/profiles/**`, `templates/objects/**`, `templates/flexipages/**`, `unpackaged/**/networks/rlm.network-meta.xml` | *(stand-alone — protected-metadata DO NOT rules)* |
| `docs-conventions.mdc` | `docs/**/*.md` | *(stand-alone — filename and placement conventions for `docs/`)* |
